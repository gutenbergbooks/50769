<h2 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<h4 id="BASIS_FOR_THE_WORK"><span class="smcap">Basis for the Work.</span></h4>

<p>The collection of the Bureau of Ethnology includes almost every type
of stone implement or ornament, and as the investigations and explorations
of the collaborators have extended over nearly all the eastern and
central portions of the Mississippi valley, it furnishes a substantial
basis for showing the geographic distribution of various forms of objects
in use among the aboriginal inhabitants.</p>

<p>It has not been deemed advisable to utilize material contained in
other collections. Should this be done there would be no reason for
drawing upon one rather than another, and if it were once begun the
examination would finally extend to every collection made from American
localities, a study which, although perhaps desirable, would transcend
the scope of the Bureau plans.</p>

<p>Much that has been published in regard to the distribution of relics
in various portions of the country is of little value to a paper of this
kind, since few of the objects are sufficiently illustrated or referred to
any class in other than the most general terms; so that it is frequently
impossible to determine the group in which a given article should be
placed. Partly for this reason, partly because the primary purpose is
description of a certain collection made in a definite way, little space
is given to the descriptive work of predecessors in the field of archeology.
The general results of previous work are, however, carefully
weighed in the conclusions reached.</p>

<h4 id="CLASSIFICATION_OF_OBJECTS_AND_MATERIALS"><span class="smcap">Classification of Objects and Materials.</span></h4>

<p>The ordinary division into chipped and pecked or ground implements
has been adopted: the former including all such as are more easily
worked by flaking, and the latter including those made from stone
suitable for working down by pecking into form with stone hammers
or by similar means. The system of nomenclature in general use has
been retained, as it is now familiar to students of North American
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
archeology, and, while not entirely satisfactory in some respects, is
perhaps as good as can be devised in the present state of knowledge.</p>

<p>Careful study of the entire collection has failed to show the slightest
difference in the form, finish, or material of implements from the same
locality, whether found in mounds or graves or on the surface; hence
no attempt is made to separate the two classes of objects. Allowance
is to be made for the weathering of a surface specimen, but this is the
only distinction.</p>

<p>It is not always easy to identify a stone, even with a fresh surface;
in a weathered specimen it is often impossible. For this reason the
material of which a specimen is made may not be correctly named; frequently
the alteration due to exposure will change the appearance of a
rock very much, and in such a case the best that can be done is to tell
what it looks most like. The material of a majority of specimens however,
or at least the classes of rock to which they belong, as granite,
porphyry, etc., are correctly named; to give a more exact name would
be possible only by the destruction or injury of the specimen. There
are a few terms used which may be here explained.</p>

<p>‚ÄúCompact quartzite‚Äù is a very hard, close-grained, siliceous rock,
sometimes nearly a flint, and again closely approaching novaculite.
‚ÄúGreenstone‚Äù may be diorite or diabase, or it may be a very compact
dark sandstone or quartzite so weathered that its nature can not be
determined from superficial observation. ‚ÄúArgillite‚Äù refers to any slaty
rock; it may be so soft as to be easily cut with a knife, or nearly as hard
as quartzite. Usually it is greenish in color.</p>

<p>A comprehensive study of all available collections will no doubt modify
materially the classification and system of types here presented.</p>

<p>The quotations from eminent anthropologists given below show the
difficulties in the way of establishing a satisfactory system of types, or
of assigning certain forms to particular localities. In most of these
quotations the substance only of the author‚Äôs remarks is given.</p>

<p>According to Dr. E. B. Tylor, the flint arrows of the Dakota, the
Apache, or the Comanche might easily be mistaken for the weapons
dug up on the banks of the Thames;<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> while cores of flint in Scandinavia
and of obsidian in Mexico are exactly alike,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> and a tray filled with European
arrowheads can not be distinguished from a tray of American
ones.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> Prof. Otis T. Mason observes that the great variety of form in
such weapons after they are finished is due partly to nature and partly
to the workman‚Äôs desire to produce a certain kind of implement. All
sorts of pebbles lie at the hand of the savage mechanic, none of them
just what he wants. He selects the best.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> Perhaps the truth about
the shape is that the savage found it thus and let it so remain.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span></p>

<p>The state of things among the lower tribes which presents itself to
the student is a substantial similarity in knowledge, arts, and customs,
running through the whole world. Not that the whole culture of all
tribes is alike&mdash;far from it; but if any art or custom belonging to a low
tribe is selected at random, the likelihood is that something substantially
like it may be found in at least one place thousands of miles off, though
it frequently happens that there are large intervening areas where it
has not been observed.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>On the whole, it seems most probable that many of the simpler
weapons, implements, etc., have been invented independently by various
savage tribes. Though they are remarkably similar, they are at
the same time curiously different. The necessaries of life are simple
and similar all over the world. The materials with which men have to
deal are also very much alike; wood, bone, and to a certain extent
stone, have everywhere the same properties. The obsidian flakes of
the Aztecs resemble the flint flakes of our ancestors, not so much because
the ancient Briton resembled the Aztec, as because the fracture
of flint is like that of obsidian. So also the pointed bones used as
awls are necessarily similar all over the world. Similarity exists, in
fact, rather in the raw material than in the manufactured article, and
some even of the simplest implements of stone are very different among
different races.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>Tylor again says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>When, however, their full value has been given to the differences in the productions
of the Ground Stone Age, there remains a residue of a most remarkable kind.
In the first place, a very small number of classes, flakes, knives, scrapers, spear and
arrow heads, celts, and hammers take in the great mass of specimens in museums;
and in the second place, the prevailing character of these implements, whether
modern or thousands of years old, whether found on this side of the world or on the
other, is a marked uniformity. The ethnographer who has studied the stone implements
of Europe, Asia, North or South America, or Polynesia, may consider the
specimens from the district he has studied as types from which those of other
districts differ, as a class, by the presence or absence of a few peculiar instruments,
and individually in more or less important details of shape or finish, unless, as sometimes
happens, they do not differ perceptibly at all. So great is this uniformity in
the stone implements of different places and times, that it goes far to neutralize
their value as distinctive of different races. It is clear that no great help in tracing
the minute history of the growth and migration of tribes is to be got from an
arrowhead which might have come from Polynesia, or Siberia, or the Isle of Man,
or from a celt which might be, for all its appearance shows, Mexican, Irish, or
Tahitian. If an observer, tolerably acquainted with stone implements, had an
unticketed collection placed before him, the largeness of the number of specimens
which he would not confidently assign, by mere inspection, to their proper countries,
would serve as a fair measure of their general uniformity. Even when aided by
mineralogical knowledge, often a great help, he would have to leave a large fraction
of the whole in an unclassified heap, confessing that he did not know within
thousands of miles or thousands of years where and when they were made.</p>

<p>How, then, is this remarkable uniformity to be explained? The principle that
man does the same thing under the same circumstances will account for much, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
it is very doubtful whether it can be stretched far enough to account for even the
greater proportion of the facts in question. The other side of the argument is, of
course, that resemblance is due to connection, and the truth is made up of the two,
though in what proportion we do not know.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While the several authors quoted do not fully agree, and some are
even slightly self-contradictory, still, if the statements are to be taken
at their face value, it would seem that efforts to make such classifications
are mainly a waste of time.</p>

<p>It may be premised that in every class of implements there are
almost as many forms as specimens, if every variation in size or pattern
is to be considered; and these merge into one another imperceptibly.
Not only is this the case with individual types, but the classes
themselves, totally unlike as their more pronounced forms may be,
gradually approach one another until there is found a medium type
whose place can not be definitely fixed.</p>

<h4 id="DISTRICTS"><span class="smcap">Districts.</span></h4>

<p>As space would be needlessly occupied by attempting to name each
county, the area from which specimens have been obtained is, for
convenience, divided into districts. These divisions are for use in this
article only, and are not intended as archeologic districts.</p>

<p>In the tables given under each heading, the names of counties or
districts show where the types described are obtained; the columns
following show the number of specimens of each material mentioned
in the collection of the Bureau.</p>

<p>Where a limited area only has been examined in any division, the
name of the county is usually given; but where specimens of any kind
have been obtained from different counties near one another, they are
assigned to the district including those counties. The districts are as
follows:</p>

<h4 id="DESCRIPTIVE_TERMS"><span class="smcap">Descriptive Terms.</span></h4>

<p>The various forms of implements will now be considered. As stated
above, the names given the various articles are those by which they are
usually known; but it may be well to define some of the terms used.</p>

<p>In the grooved axes, <i>edge</i> refers to the cutting portion; <i>blade</i>, to the
part below the groove; <i>poll</i> or <i>head</i>, to that above the groove; <i>face</i>, to
the wider or flat portion of the surface; <i>side</i>, to the narrower part;
<i>front</i>, to that side farther from the hand, and <i>back</i>, to the side nearer
the hand when in use.</p>

<p>In celts, the terms are the same, so far as they are applicable; <i>blade</i>
referring to the lower half of the implement; that is, to the portion on
which the cutting edge is formed.</p>

<h3 id="GROUND_AND_PECKED_ARTICLES"><span class="smcap">Ground and Pecked Articles.</span></h3>

<h4 id="GROOVED_AXES"><span class="smcap">Grooved Axes.</span></h4>

<p>The implements known as grooved axes seem to be of general distribution
throughout the United States; being, so far can be learned from
various writers, much more numerous east of Mississippi river than
west of it. It must be remembered, however, that thousands of diligent
collectors have carefully searched for such things in the east, while in
the west little attention has been paid to them; consequently, deductions
are not to be made concerning their relative abundance or scarcity,
until further knowledge is gained. The same remark will apply to
every form of aboriginal relic.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span></p>

<p>In the eastern and interior states, the grooved axes are far more
abundant than the celts of the same size<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>, because as a rule only the
larger implements of this class are grooved. All the ordinary varieties
of axes and hatchets are found about Lake Champlain, by far the most
abundant being celts, or grooveless axes.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>According to Adair and other early observers, the southern Indians
had axes of stone, around the grooved heads of which they twisted
hickory withes to serve as handles; with these they deadened timber
by girdling or cutting through the bark.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> According to travelers of a
later generation among the western Indians, similar implements were
used on the plains to chop up the vertebr&aelig; of buffaloes, which were
boiled to obtain the marrow.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<p>These statements, which might be multiplied, show that such objects
are to be found widely scattered;
none, however, give information
more definite than that the axes
are ‚Äúgrooved,‚Äù no reference being
made to the shape of the ax or the
manner of grooving.</p>

<p>The various modes of mounting
axes and celts in handles are illustrated
in the Smithsonian Report
for 1879.</p>

<p>Stone axes were used in Europe
by the Germans at as late a period
as the Thirty Years‚Äô war, and are
supposed to have been used by the
Anglo-Saxons at the battle of Hastings.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 29.</span>&mdash;Grooved ax, showing groove projections.</p>
</div>

<p>Axes having two grooves occur
in considerable numbers in the pueblos of southwestern United States,
but they are extremely rare elsewhere and unknown in most districts;
as the objects are generally small, the utility of the second groove is
not evident.</p>

<p>The arrangement of stone axes may be based upon the manner of
forming the groove. In one class are placed those which in the process
of making had a ridge left encircling the weapon, in which the groove
was formed. This gives the ax greater strength with the same material.
Usually the groove has been worked just deep enough to reach
the body of the ax; that is, to such a depth that should the projections
be ground off there would remain a celt-like implement (as shown in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
<a href="#FIG_29">figure 29</a>, of chlorite-schist, from Sullivan county, Tennessee). The axes
of this class in the Bureau collection are shown in the following table:</p>

<p>In the second class the groove is formed by pecking into the body
of the ax after the latter is dressed into shape; in this pattern a regular
continuous line from edge to poll would touch only the margins of
the groove, leaving it beneath. An apparent medium between the two
is sometimes seen, in which there is a projection on the lower side of the
groove only; this is due, usually, to dressing the blade down thinner
after the implement was originally worked to a symmetric outline.
By continuous or long use the edge of the ax becomes broken or
blunted and requires sharpening, and in
order to keep the proper outline to make
the tool efficient, it is necessary to work
the blade thinner as it becomes shorter.
No such change is required in the poll,
consequently a projection is formed where
originally there was no trace of one.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="FIG_30" src="images/fig_30.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 30.</span>&mdash;Grooved ax, showing pointed
edge.</p>
</div>

<p>There are different methods of finishing
the ax, which may appear with either
form of groove. The poll may be worked
into the shape of a flattened hemisphere,
may be flat on top, with the part between
the groove and the top straight, convex
or concave, or may be worked to a blunt
point, with straight or concave lines to
the groove. The blade may taper from
the groove to the edge, with straight or
curved sides, which may run almost parallel or may be drawn to a
blunt-pointed edge. This latter form is probably due to breaking or
wearing of the blade, which is reworked, as shown in <a href="#FIG_30">figure 30</a>, of granite,
from Boone county, Missouri.</p>

<p>There are a very few specimens, as noted below, in which the ax
gradually increases in width from the poll to the edge; but such specimens
seem to be made of stones which had this form approximately at
the beginning, and were worked into such shape as would give a suitable
implement with the least labor.</p>

<p>In nearly every instance the groove of an ax with a groove projection
extends entirely around with practically the same depth, and the blade
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
of the ax has an elliptical section. There are, however, a few with the
back flattened; and while many of the second division may be similar in
section, and in having the groove extend entirely around, yet in this
class are to be placed nearly all of those only partly encircled by a
groove or showing some other section than the ellipse.</p>

<p>With these exceptions, the second class of grooved stone axes comprises
seven groups, which may be described and tabulated as follows:</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Grooved entirely around, elliptical section, polls dressed in any
of the ways given above; three or four have the blunt-pointed edge
(<a href="#FIG_31">figure 31</a>, of granite, from Bradley county, Tennessee).</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Grooved on both faces and one side, with both sides flat. There
is only one of this form in the collection; it is of argillite, from Keokuk,
Iowa.</p>

<p><i>G.</i> Grooved on faces only, with both sides flat (<a href="#FIG_38">figure 38</a>, of granite,
from Keokuk, Iowa). There are from the same place one of porphyry,
one of argillite, and three of sienite. This and the preceding form
seem peculiar to that locality.</p>

<p>There are a few exceptional forms which are not placed with those
just given, since they may have some features common to all except
the Keokuk type, while in other respects they differ from all. Among
them are some entire-grooved or grooved only on the two sides and one
face; the general outline may correspond with some of the regular
forms, but one face is curved from poll to edge, while the other is
straight or nearly so (<a href="#FIG_39">figure 39</a>, of granite, from Wilkes county, North
Carolina). This specimen has a depression, as if worn by the end of a
handle, on the straight face at the lower edge of the groove.</p>

<p>None of this form are long enough for hoes, and although they may
have been used for axes and hatchets, their shape seems to indicate
use as adzes. Besides the one figured there are two from Savannah,
Georgia; three from eastern Tennessee, one with a slight groove and
very deep side notches; and three from western North Carolina, two of
them entire-grooved with groove projections.

</div>

<p>Another unusual form, which may come under any of the foregoing
figures, has the groove crossing the implement diagonally, in such a
way as to cause the blade to incline backward (<a href="#FIG_40">figure 40</a>, of granite,
from Carter county, Tennessee). Besides the specimen illustrated, this
form is also represented by one of granite from northwestern North
Carolina with projection for groove; two of argillite from southwestern
Tennessee; one, widest at edge, from Savannah, Georgia; one from
Ross county, Ohio; and two of granite, highly polished, grooved on
faces and one side, with backs flat, from Kanawha valley, West
Virginia.</p>

<p>Of the axes wider at the edge than at any point above (of which the
specimen illustrated in <a href="#FIG_41">figure 41</a>, of granite, from a
grave at Kingsport, Tennessee, may be taken as a
type,) there are one of diorite from Kanawha valley,
West Virginia, which seems to
have been of ordinary pattern but
broken and redressed to its present
form; and from Savannah,
Georgia, one of uniform taper with
diagonal groove, and one widening
irregularly until the blade is fully
twice the width of the poll.</p>

</div>

<p>Many, if not a majority, of the
entire-grooved axes have the
groove wide enough for a very large handle, or for
an ordinary withe to be twisted twice around. In
those which have one side ungrooved, the intention
was to admit a wedge between the stone and the
curve of the handle. The handles were very firmly
fastened; two axes in the collection have been broken in such a way
that on one side, from the top half way down, the blade is gone, carrying
away the groove on that side; yet the polish of the groove extends
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
over the fractured surface, which has never been reworked, showing
that the tool was long used after this accident. As the handles could
easily slip off over the top in specimens thus broken, they must have
been tightly lashed; perhaps gum or glue was used.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="FIG_42" src="images/fig_42.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 42.</span>&mdash;Grooved ax, showing curved edge.</p>
</div>

<p>Partly finished specimens show that the groove was pecked out and
the edge ground before the remaining parts of
the ax were worked. Some have the edge ground
sharp and the groove worn smooth or even polished
by long use, while all the rest of the implement
retains the original weathered surface. A stone
was always chosen that could be brought to the
desired form with the least labor, and very often
one could be found that required but little work to
make a very satisfactory weapon or implement or
even ornament.</p>

<p>Occasionally specimens indicate by the manner
of wear their application to certain kinds of work.
Sometimes the edge is curved by the wearing away
of one face until it has almost a gouge form; sometimes
the side of the blade next the hand, again
that farthest away, is more worn. This in time
would give the blunt-pointed edge. A peculiar
finish of the lower part of the blade, which is also
seen in a few celts, is shown in <a href="#FIG_42">figure 42</a>, of sienite,
from Carter county, Tennessee. One half of each
face has been left full, and the part opposite hollowed
out, giving an ogee curve to the edge. <a href="#FIG_43">Figure 43</a>, of granite,
from Jefferson county, Tennessee, seems to have a ridge on the upper
side of the groove; but closer examination shows that it once had a
groove projection, and that afterwards the poll
was nearly all broken away and a new groove
made lower down, so that what was originally
the lower projection is now above the groove,
the remainder of the poll being worked down
to a point.</p>

<p>There are a few hammers which differ from
the ordinary ax only in being blunt instead
of sharp. They may be nothing more than
broken axes, utilized as hammers instead of
being resharpened.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="FIG_43" src="images/fig_43.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 43.</span>&mdash;Grooved ax, showing single groove projection.</p>
</div>

<p>Under this head may be placed implements
plainly used as adzes. They are much longer than axes in proportion
to their other dimensions, have one face convex, the other straight or
concave. They may be placed in the same class as the specimen shown
in <a href="#FIG_39">figure 39</a>, and also those represented in <a href="#FIG_44">figures 44</a> and <a href="#FIG_45">45</a>, from
McMinn county, Tennessee. There is also a similar adze from Saline
county, Arkansas. All the specimens of this class are of argillite.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span></p>

<p>With the grooved axes is also placed a class of implements that may
be called axes notched on the sides. Many of them were no doubt used
as sinkers; but some of the same form, size, and material have the
notches and sometimes portions of the face worn perfectly smooth, while
frequently they are ground to a sharp edge. Again, even in those
that have not the least polish, the edge shows marks that would seem
to result from use as axes, adzes, or hoes.</p>

<p>There are three divisions of this class of implements, as follows:</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Unworked, except notches; probably sinkers.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> Roughly chipped, with notches often at the middle but sometimes
nearer one end. Probably most of these were sinkers; but as above
stated the edges show marks of use, apparently in scraping, digging,
or striking. Of these the following examples are in the Bureau collection:
From several localities in eastern Tennessee, 40 of argillite; from
Montgomery county, North Carolina, 24 of argillite and quartzite;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
from Kanawha valley, West Virginia, and from Savannah, Georgia, a
few specimens of the same materials.</p>

<h4 id="CELTS"><span class="smcap">Celts.</span></h4>

<p>What is true of the uses and distribution of stone axes applies with
much the same force to what are called celts&mdash;not a good descriptive
term, but one which is now given to the implement in lieu of something
better. It would appear difficult or impossible to do with these rude
tools any work for which we commonly use an ax or hatchet; and yet,
by the aid of fire, or even without it, the aborigines contrived to accomplish
a great deal with them.</p>

<p>The Maori of New Zealand do all their wonderful work of wood
carving with only a chisel or adze (of stone or shell).<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> Among the
Iroquois, in cutting trees, fire was applied at the root, the coals were
scraped away with a chisel, and this process was repeated until the
tree was felled. The trunk was divided into lengths in the same way.
Similarly canoes and mortars were hollowed out.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> The Virginia Indians
at an early day employed a similar process.
They also cleared ground for cultivation by
deadening trees with their tomahawks,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>
and used adzes made of shell in cleaning
out the charred wood in making canoes.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>
The Nootka of the northwestern part of
the continent in felling a tree use a flint or
elkhorn set in a handle, this being struck
with a stone mallet. In hollowing canoes
a musselshell also is used as an adze, and
sometimes fire is applied. The outside is
shaped by similar means.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<img id="FIG_46" src="images/fig_46.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 46.</span>&mdash;Notched ax, showing polished edge.</p>
</div>

<p>Stone chisels have been found in various
steatite quarries, where vessels and other
utensils of this material were made, and the marks of their use is plain
both on the vessels in an unfinished state and on the cores, as well as
on the quarry face.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>The different ways of hafting, as shown by specimens in the Bureau
collection, were as follows:</p>

<p>(1) A hole was cut entirely through a stick and the celt was inserted
so that it would project on both sides;</p>

<p>(2) The hole was cut partly through, and the celt was pushed in as
far as it would go;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span></p>

<p>(3) The top of the celt was set in a socket of deer horn, which was
put into a handle as in form 2;</p>

<p>(4) Small celt-shaped knives or scrapers were set into the end of a
piece of antler long enough to be used as a handle;</p>

<p>(5) A forked branch was so cut as to make two prongs of nearly
equal length, and the celt was fastened to the end of one, parallel with
it, the other being used to guide and steady it, a prong being held in
each hand;</p>

<p>(6) The fork of a root or branch was trimmed so as to make a flat face
at any desired angle, to which the celt was lashed, a shoulder, against
which the end of the celt was set, being sometimes cut in the wood;</p>

<p>(7) A stick was split its entire length and a single turn taken around
the celt, the ends being brought together and tied, forming a round
handle;</p>

<p>(8) A stick was split part way, one fork cut off and the other wrapped
once or twice and tied, thus forming a round handle of solid wood.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Forms 5 and 6 were used as adzes; forms 7 and 8 are the same
methods as employed in hafting grooved axes.</p>

<p>A mounting similar to form 4 is seen in some Alaska specimens of
celt-scrapers in which the implement is fastened to a piece of wood so
as to project a short distance, and used like a plane. In all these, the
celt is very firmly fastened to the handle with sinew or rawhide, which,
when put on green, contracts with great force and binds like wire.</p>

<p>As to the forms of celts, no division is practicable based on anything
but their entire appearance. The following descriptions and tabulations
represent the material of this kind in the Bureau collection:</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Round or nearly round section, pointed or flattened at the top,
blade rapidly thickening from the edge; a few are polished at the top,
but most of them show marks of a maul or hammer; all have been highly
polished; all of this class were probably used as wedges, as their
shape renders them more fit for this purpose than for any other; the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
battered tops indicate such usage. The few not showing such marks
may have been set into a bumper of wood or horn, or used with wooden
mauls. They vary in length from 2&frac12; to 7&frac12; inches. They are represented
by the specimen shown in <a href="#FIG_47">figure 47</a>, of argillite, from Lincoln county,
Arkansas; there are also one from a mound in Sumter county, Alabama
(<a href="#FIG_48">figure 48</a>), and one from Kanawha valley, West Virginia, both of
serpentine and elliptical in section, though the form of the edge puts
them in this class. The following specimens are typical representations
of the class:</p>

<p><i>C.</i> Thick, almost round section, round-pointed top, nearly straight
to sharp-curved edge, sides gently curved, widest at edge or just above.
Most of these show marks of use as cutting tools or hatchets. In
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
many the top has been roughened as if for insertion into a hole cut
in a piece of wood; others have this roughening around the middle or
immediately above, leaving a polish at both ends, and these were hafted
probably by means of a stick or withe twisted around them. The
roughening is a secondary operation, having no relation
to the making of the implement; it was produced by pecking
after the surface was polished. In a
few cases it extends from the top well
down the sides; but usually it reaches
but a little way below the top, or else is
in a circle around the body of the celt.
Most of them have sharp edges; a few
have edges either chipped or blunted
and polished, showing long usage. Two
from Kanawha valley (one roughened for
handle) have the edges worn in on one
of the faces until they almost resemble
gouges; but that they were not intended
as such is shown by the concavity being
nearer one side and not reaching entirely
across. The length ranges from 4&frac12; to 10
inches. The type is illustrated by <a href="#FIG_50">figures 50</a> and <a href="#FIG_51">51</a>, both
of sienite, from Lauderdale county, Tennessee.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 52.</span>&mdash;Celt, showing nearly diamond
section.</p>
</div>

<p><i>E.</i> Pointed oval, or nearly diamond section, sides straight or slightly
curved; length 6 to 12&frac12; inches. Few as these are, they vary considerably
in appearance. The group is illustrated by <a href="#FIG_52">figure 52</a>, showing a
specimen of brown flint, containing
numerous small deposits of chalcedony,
from Benton county, Tennessee; polished
over the entire surface, the edge highly
so.</p>

<p>In addition, there are the following
examples: From Caldwell county, North
Carolina, one of porphyry and one of
granite, the latter roughened on sides
for handle; from McMinn county, Tennessee,
one of gray flint, highly polished
over its surface, except the top, which
is much battered; from Cocke county,
Tennessee, one of argillite.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Elliptical section, flattened or
rounded top, edge curved or nearly
straight, sides straight or gently curved,
tapering from edge to top or in a few
cases nearly parallel. These present
many variations in finish and in evidence
of use. Some are well polished
over the entire surface; some have only the lower part polished; while
some are entirely without polish except at the extreme edge. In some
the top is battered; some have the surface roughened for handle at
the top, others around the middle, still others all over the upper half
or even more than half. One from McMinn county, Tennessee, has a
roughly pecked shallow groove at the middle. Several have the edge
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
very blunt, the faces at the edge form almost a right angle; these are
thickest very near the edge and become gradually thinner toward the
top. Most of this kind are from Caldwell county, North Carolina; the
same form coming also from Monroe county, Tennessee, and from
Savannah, Georgia. The length is from 3 to 7&frac12; inches. <a href="#FIG_53">Figure 53</a>, of
compact quartzite, from Monroe county, Tennessee; <a href="#FIG_54">figure 54</a>, of granite;

widen just before reaching the edge, giving a ‚Äúbell
shape‚Äù (<a href="#FIG_56">figure 56</a>). The length is from 6&frac14; to 8

parallel or nearly so, sometimes
very slightly curved.
Most have polished surfaces;
only three or four show any
battering, or roughening for
handle. A large one of
hornblende from Lauderdale
county, Tennessee, has the
edge dulled and polished by
use. Length is from 2 to 9

<p><i>J.</i> Flat on one side, convex on the other, giving a semi-elliptical section;
sides nearly parallel; top flat or rounded. These were evidently
intended for scrapers; none are at all chipped or battered from use,
and with very few exceptions the whole surface is highly polished. The
flint and jasper specimens, which have been first chipped into shape,
have the facets and edge as smooth as though finished on an emery
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
wheel. Similar forms, except with flat instead of convex upper surfaces,
are known to have been used as adzes, but these have no marks
of such use. The length ranges from 2 to 8 inches, but most are small.

county, Illinois.</p>

large size; it measures 5&frac12; inches, being the only one exceeding

<p><i>N.</i> Ground down thin, with a flat-elliptical or nearly rectangular
section; sides straight or slightly curved, nearly parallel or tapering
considerably to the top, which is either rounded or flattened. All are
polished over the entire surface; none show any marks of use as wedges
or hatchets, and most of them are too delicate for such use. The longer
ones can be readily grasped in the hand, and are as well adapted to
stripping off the hide of an animal, dividing the skeleton at the joints,
or stripping the flesh from the bones, as anything made of stone can be;
while the smaller ones, set in a handle to afford a grip, would answer the
same purpose. There are three which are sharp at both ends, one having
one symmetrical and one scraper-form edge; one having a scraper-form
edge at each end on opposite sides; and one of rather soft argillite,
unfinished, which has marks of pecking, chipping, and grinding, showing
that any of these methods were practiced, as was most convenient.
All these are from eastern Tennessee. The features are illustrated in

<h4 id="GOUGES"><span class="smcap">Gouges.</span></h4>

<p>While there are perhaps no true gouges in the collection, there are
some examples of a form between a celt and a gouge, illustrated in <a href="#FIG_65">figure
65</a>, of serpentine, from Caldwell county, North Carolina.</p>

<p>Implements of this form are known to have been used to tap sugar
maples, and also to hollow out wooden troughs, and are very common
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
in the north, though less abundant in the south.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> It is in those localities
in which bark instead of logs was used for canoes that they are
most numerous. Sometimes they were hollowed the whole length and
used as spiles.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> They were also employed instead of celts in hollowing
wooden mortars and the like when a more regular concavity was desired.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<h4 id="CHISELS_AND_SCRAPERS"><span class="smcap">Chisels and Scrapers.</span></h4>

<p>The aboriginal implements known as ‚Äúchisels‚Äù are round, elliptical,
or rectangular in section. The flint and jasper specimens are generally
widest at the edge, the reverse being usually the case
with those of other material. Most of them have marks
of hammers at the blunt end, though some are polished
at the top and a few, from eastern Tennessee, are sharp
at both ends. The top (except in the double-edged
ones) is usually flat, though a few are pointed or very
thin, almost with cutting edges. Jaspers and flints are
chipped, with the facets polished, the edges highly
so. Any form may occur in any locality. Almost
invariably they have scraper-form edges. The length
is from 2 to 6 inches.</p>

<p>The high polish sometimes found on the top of a round-pointed celt
may be due to its working slightly in the socket in its handle of wood,
deerhorn, or other material.</p>

<p>By celts having a scraper-form edge is meant those having the edge
to one side of the median line, due to constant use of one
face. This face, at the edge, is in a straight line from side
to side; it may have a chisel-like flattening, or may curve
toward the middle of the celt for a short
distance and then have the same form to
the top as the other face, which is convex
or curved, as in the ordinary hatchet-celt.
They form a medium between celts whose
faces gradually curve from top to edge,
and the celt-scrapers which are flat on one
side. Among the thicker celts this form is
quite rare, though several, especially one
from Kanawha valley, West Virginia (represented
in <a href="#FIG_74">figure 74</a>), are quite pronounced.
In the thinner specimens, however, a majority are of this
pattern, while in some types, nearly all indeed, even
those up to 6 inches long, are so beveled. The type,
of which an illustration is shown in <a href="#FIG_71">figure 71</a>, is of very
hard black slate; the same form is presented in <a href="#FIG_66">figures 66</a> and <a href="#FIG_70">70</a>.</p>

<p>From Bartow county, Georgia, is a scraper made from the edge of
a celt which has been broken diagonally across from one face to the
other. A stem like that of a spear-head has been formed by chipping
away the sides of the part broken, which gives a convenient attachment
for a handle; the original edge is unchanged except in the wear
which has resulted from its new use.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span></p>

<p>The specimen shown in <a href="#FIG_72">figure 72</a> (of argillite, from McMinn county,
Tennessee) is introduced on account of its undoubted use as a scraper,
and because it is much smaller than some of the chipped flints thus
classified, the edge being less than an inch wide; the sides are roughly
incurved.</p>

<p>In Bradley county, Tennessee, there were found over 200 specimens
of very small, thin, flat, waterworn sandstone pebbles,
which were mostly in their natural condition, except
that they had one side rubbed to a sharp edge.
A few, more slender, were ground to a point. Some
of them have a handle chipped out
on the side opposite the edge, sometimes
with nicks in it, made for attachment
to a handle by means of a
cord. Most of these specimens are less than 2 inches
in length. No suggestion is offered as to their use.</p>

<p>A granite implement from Union county, Illinois, with
nearly rectangular section, slightly curved sides,
rounded corners, and high polish over the entire
surface, having nearly the same thickness (about an
inch) at every part, would seem to be a polishing or
rubbing stone. There are, however, one from Warren
county, Ohio, and three from Kanawha valley,
West Virginia, of almost exactly the same size and
pattern, which have had one end ground off to a sharp edge; so the
specimen may be only an unfinished celt. One of those from Kanawha
valley has had the edge partly broken away, and one face has been
pecked considerably in an attempt to restore it for use; but the intention
was not carried out. Some celts, not of the scraper pattern, which
have the edge to one side of the median line, are perhaps broken or
blunted specimens redressed on one side only.</p>

<p><a href="#FIG_73">Figure 73</a> exhibits a specimen of argillite from Carter county, Tennessee,
probably an adze or scraper, with a projection to keep the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
implement from being forced into the handle. The edge is symmetrical,
though much striated. The specimen shown in <a href="#FIG_74">figure 74</a> (of granite,
from Kanawha valley, West Virginia) represents a peculiar form. There
are several like it in the collection, all but this one from islands in the
Pacific.</p>

<h4 id="CHIPPED_CELTS"><span class="smcap">Chipped Celts.</span></h4>

<p>On account of their shape and undoubted
use, a class of celts, although neither pecked
nor ground, is introduced. Many of them resemble,
in most respects, the so-called paleolithic
implements, though sometimes of better
finish. They are made with a rounded top and
nearly parallel sides; rudely triangular; or
with the sides curved to a point at the top.
The edge may be straight or curved, and is
usually chipped, though sometimes ground; a
few are chisel-shaped. Usually they show no
signs of wear; when they do, it is always in
the form of a polish at the larger end, or on
the exposed facets. One of black flint, 8 inches
long, from Kanawha valley, has a scraper-form
edge, smoothly polished. Many, even of those scarcely changed
from their original form and natural surface, have the
edges dulled and polished from use as scrapers or
adzes.</p>

<p>The collection includes the following examples:
36 of argillite, flint, porphyry,
and compact quartzite, from Montgomery
county, North Carolina, some with the wider
edge sharp (<a href="#FIG_75">figure 75</a>, of flint); 12 of limestone
and flint from Mason county, Kentucky;
70 of argillite, a few with the edges
ground, from southeastern Tennessee (<a href="#FIG_76">figure
76</a>, from McMinn county); over 300 from
Kanawha valley, nearly all of black flint,
a few being of diorite or quartzite&mdash;some
are partly polished, or have ground edges
(<a href="#FIG_77">figure 77</a>, of black flint, from a mound).</p>

<h4 id="HEMATITE_CELTS"><span class="smcap">Hematite Celts.</span></h4>

<p>With the exception of two from Iowa and a few from Preston county,
West Virginia, the hematite celts in the collection are from Kanawha
valley, and are small, ranging in length from 1 to 2&frac34; inches, except one
4&frac12; and one 5&frac12; inches. They are illustrated in figures 78, 79, 80, and 81,
the last from a mound. Nearly all have been ground directly from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
nodule or concretion in which this ore of iron so frequently appears.
Occasionally one of homogeneous structure has been chipped into form
before grinding, the facets in some cases being rubbed nearly away.
Sometimes they have a rectangular outline, but usually the sides taper
from the edge to the top by a gradual
curve, or are parallel a part of the way
and then taper either by a straight or,
oftener, by a curved line. The section is
rectangular or elliptical.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 78.</span>&mdash;Hematite celt.</p>
</div>

<p>These implements were probably used as
knives or scrapers, being set into the end
of a piece of antler, which may in turn
have been set into a larger handle of wood.
That some were knives is shown by the edge which is dulled to a flat
polished surface extending from side to side; and that many were scrapers
is shown by their celt-scraper shape, a half elliptical section, or by
the scraper-form edge, seen in the largest specimen. Some, however,
have the edge symmetrical, as in the hatchet-celts. One has incurved
sides, and is roughened on the sides and on the faces near the top.</p>

<h4 id="PESTLES"><span class="smcap">Pestles.</span></h4>

<p>The fact of the ordinary conical or bell-shaped, long-cylindrical, or
somewhat pear-shaped stones having been used for pestles is so well
settled that no confirmatory references are needed. A few citations
may be given in regard to certain forms sometimes differently classed,
especially some of the discoidal stones to be hereafter described.</p>

<p>According to Stevens, the corn crushers used by the Swiss lake
dwellers are spherical; some are flattened on two sides, like an orange,
others almost round with depressions on four sides. They are about
the size of a man‚Äôs fist or rather smaller. The Africans have a piece
of quartz or other hard stone as large as half a brick, one side of
which is convex, to fit the hollow of a larger stone used as a mortar.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>
Evans observes that disks sometimes show marks of use as hammers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
or pestles;<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> one found at Ty Mawr was thick, with a cavity on
each face.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> In preparing pemmican, the American Indians are known
to have pounded the dried meat to a powder between two stones.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a>
This gives the impression that any suitable stones may have been used;
and the ancient California Indians worked
out a round stone as an acorn sheller,
modern tribes using any smooth stone.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 82.</span>&mdash;Handled pestle, with expanding
base.</p>
</div>

<p>The pestles which have the bottom round
or convex are generally found in the same
localities as the hollowed stone mortars.
Several forms of pestles are represented in
the collection. They may be grouped as in
the following description and tabulation.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> With expanding base; bottom flat or
slightly convex, often with a slight depression
in the middle. Handle tapering, or of
uniform diameter to the top; in a few,
slightly swelling above as if to give a
firmer hold. Top rounded, flat, or pointed.
Bottom may be very little expanded or may
have twice the diameter of the handle.
Probably used for pounding grain or seeds
on a flat stone, as it could not be used in a
mortar even slightly hollowed. None seem to have been used as mullers
or rubbers. They may have served for hammers, and would be excellent
for cracking nuts, as the pit in the bottom would tend to keep them
from flying out to the side. The type is shown in <a href="#FIG_82">figure 82</a>, of quartzite,
from Sullivan county, Tennessee. The distribution is moderately wide,
and the material chiefly granite and quartzite, with a few of other rock
varieties, as shown in the table:</p>

<p><i>B.</i> Almost cylindrical, from 6 to 18 inches long and about two inches
in diameter. Some of the larger ones were probably rolling-pins, as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
the ends, either from some fancy finish, or because worked to a point,
are of a shape that would make their use as pestles impracticable.
Even as rollers, some must have been used for crushing grain that had
previously been softened or was not fully matured, as they are of a soft
stone that would wear very easily. The shorter ones are
blunt at the ends, and may have been used in a shallow
wooden mortar; none are adapted for use in stone. The
class is illustrated by <a href="#FIG_83">figure 83</a>, of soft clay slate, from
Cherokee county, Georgia.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> Conical, or truncated cone, bottom flat, convex or
curved from one side to the opposite. Some are quite
smooth on the bottom
as if from rubbing
either back and forth
or with a rotary
motion; while many
have the bottom
pecked rough, showing
use as hammers
or pounders. For those

a rocking motion
seems best adapted; with the
palm resting on the longer side,
good work could be done in any

of quartzite, from Saline county,

specimen, shown in <a href="#FIG_87">figure 87</a>, of
granite, from Carter county, Tennessee, has an elliptical base, rounded
top, and flat bottom; the longer sides grooved for handle. A similar
one, of quartzite, came from Warren county, Ohio. There is considerable
variety of material, quartzite largely predominating. Although

<h4 id="PITTED_STONES"><span class="smcap">Pitted Stones.</span></h4>

<p>There is scarcely a locality in the country where pitted stones are
not found; they are indeed of such frequent occurrence that they are
seldom considered worth the trouble of gathering.</p>

<p>There can be no ‚Äútype‚Äù among such crude implements; they are
almost invariably waterworn sandstone pebbles, with a pit varying
from a slight roughening of the surface to a hollow half an inch in depth
pecked in each face. They probably belong with hammerstones, as
they seldom show other marks of work, the edge in some being only
slightly marked in one or two places, while in others it is much worn.</p>

<p>Various numbers of the Journal of the Anthropological Society of
Great Britain and Ireland refer to pitted stones as found in every part
of the world. According to Evans, slight pits aid in holding stone
hammers; they also prevent the jar to a large extent. If used to pound
meat or break bones, it would be hard to hold them when greasy without
pits.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> Such implements may have had handles of wood with projections
to fit the pits,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> though this is not probable; but if so a piece of
buckskin on the handle opposite the pits would do better and be more
convenient to apply.</p>

<h4 id="CUPPED_STONES"><span class="smcap">Cupped Stones.</span></h4>

<p>Conjecture and theory have had full sway in regard to the uses of
cupped stones; but the question is apparently far from solution. There
is a prevalent idea that they were used for cracking nuts; but why should
an Indian make a large number of holes in a great many stones for such
purpose? It is true there would be an advantage in having the nut stand
on one end; but very few stones have depressions that will allow this.</p>

<p>Of the southern Indians Adair observes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>They gather a number of hiccory-nuts, which they pound with a round stone, upon
a stone, thick and hollowed for the purpose. When they are beat fine enough, they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
mix them with cold water, in a clay basin, where the shells subside. The other
part is an oily, tough, thick, white substance ... with which they eat their
bread.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Lawson‚Äôs language regarding the Indians of North Carolina is even
more definite. He says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[They gather] likewise hickerie nuts, which they beat betwixt two great stones,
then sift them, so thicken their venison broth therewith, the small shells precipitating
to the bottom of the pot, whilst the kernel, in the form of flour, mixes it with
the liquor, both these nuts [hickory and chinquapin] made into meal makes a curious
soup, either with clear water, or in any meat broth.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Neither of these statements seems to have any reference to cupped
stones. The first is a good description of a mortar with a round pestle,
while the second says nothing about any particular form of stone; yet
they have been referred to time and again as proof of the nut-stone
theory. There would be some difficulty in pounding nuts fine in small
holes half an inch or more below where the pounding stone could reach.</p>

<p>C. C. Jones<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> was satisfied that cupped stones were used for cracking
nuts because great numbers of nut-bearing trees grow where they are
found; while Whittlesey, noting the fact that hundreds of them are
found throughout northern Ohio, considered them as sockets in which
the end of a spindle rested. Dawson<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> speaks of ‚Äústones having deep
hollows in the sides which were mortars for grinding pigments, or
sockets for fire drills.‚Äù</p>

<p>The cupped stones in the Bureau collection are almost invariably of
reddish sandstone, of varying texture, from a few ounces to 30 pounds
in weight. The holes are from one to twenty-five in number, of various
sizes even in the same stone, and follow the natural contour of the surface
even when that is quite irregular; the stone is never dressed or
flattened to bring the cups on a level; none show any marks of work,
but are the rough blocks or slabs in their natural state.</p>

<p>Many of the holes are roughly pecked in, but the larger ones are
usually quite smooth, as if ground out, and almost complete hemispheres.
They range from a pit only started or going scarcely beyond
the surface to one 2 inches in diameter. The smaller ones with one
cup pass into the pitted stones. Occasionally at the bottom of a large
cup there is a small secondary hole as though made by a flint drill.</p>

<p>The polished cups may have been used for fire-drill or spindle sockets,
though why there should be a number of holes when but one could
be used at a time awaits explanation. The rough ones may have been
for holding nuts, and so long as they were on the same plane any
number could be utilized; but when they are on different parts of the
stone, even on opposite sides, as many of them are, the question remains
open. Slabs or thin pieces nearly always have cups on both
sides, while blocks or thick slabs have them on one side only. On the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
former a number of nuts could be cracked with one blow of a flat stone
and thrown into a receptacle of some kind, either side of the stone being
used at pleasure; but there would be no economy of time or work
in this method, and it would be very strange that any one should not
learn with so much experience that a nut should never be laid on the
flat side in cracking. No theory yet advanced accounts for the greater
number of such relics, namely, the irregular fragments of stone with
cups at varying intervals and different levels.</p>

<p>No division can be made in regard either to size or material of the
stone, or to form or finish of the cups. Many of the
smaller ones were no doubt paint mortars. One well
finished specimen of this class is shown in <a href="#FIG_89">figure 89</a>;
it is of quartzite from 4 feet beneath the surface in
Crittenden county, Arkansas.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 89.</span>&mdash;Cupped stone

<p>Cupped stones are found wherever representatives
of the Bureau have worked, and numerous references
might be given concerning their existence in other localities.</p>

<h4 id="MULLERS"><span class="smcap">Mullers.</span></h4>

<p>The objects known as mullers are generally flat and smooth on one
side and convex on the other, sometimes with a pit in one side or both,
mostly of granite, quartzite, or sandstone; rarely of other materials.</p>

<p>A fine specimen of white quartz from Elmore county, Alabama, has
the bottom flat and highly polished, the edge perpendicular to bottom
and rounding off into the slightly convex top,
with a pit at center. <a href="#FIG_90">Figure 90</a> represents a
muller of marble or crystalline limestone from
a grave in Randolph county, Illinois. It has a
smooth, flat bottom, with convex top somewhat
smaller than the base; around the circumference
there is a depression polished by wear.
A similar specimen, of diorite, from Carter
county, Tennessee, seems to be the lower part of
a pestle with expanding base, whose top or handle has been lost, the
part remaining having a place for a handle pecked around it.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 90.</span>&mdash;Muller, showing polished
surface.</p>
</div>

<p>The discoidal stones with this shape were probably used as mullers;
they were also used as pestles in the hollow mortars, as the edge is
often chipped or pecked, which would account for the pits on the faces.
<a href="#FIG_91">Figure 91</a> represents a muller of granite from Savannah, Georgia. Sometimes
the base has an elliptical instead of a circular outline, as seen
in other specimens from Savannah.</p>

<p>Mullers are found wherever there are indications of occupancy for
any considerable length of time.</p>

<h4 id="GRINDING_AND_POLISHING_STONES"><span class="smcap">Grinding and Polishing Stones.</span></h4>

<p>Stones evidently used for grinding and polishing need only to be mentioned,
as they are of widespread occurrence. Implements used for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
former purpose are made of any siliceous stone of convenient size and
suitable texture, from a coarse quartzite to a very fine close-grained
sandstone, according to the class of work to be done. The markings
on them range from the narrow, sharp, incised lines due to shaping a
small ornament, to the broad grooves resulting from grinding an ax or
celt into form. Nearly all of those in museums are small specimens
used for rubbing; but there are many large blocks in various localities,
sometimes several feet square, marked and scored in every direction
by grinding or sharpening the large implements on them.</p>

<p>Among the polishers may be included a number of small pebbles of
very hard siliceous stone, generally some form of quartz, which by the
high polish show long use. The larger ones may have been used for
rubbing skins in tanning, as they can easily be grasped in the hand.
Very few have changed from their primitive form to a greater degree
than would naturally result from the wear upon them. A few very
small ones, long-ovoid in shape, usually not over 2&frac12; or 3 inches in
length, were probably paint mullers, as they are well fitted for use in
small paint cups. Many of the discoidal stones&mdash;which will be spoken
of under the proper head&mdash;may have had these functions. The highly
polished specimens are all from the southern states. There is one
rubbing stone of pumice from Craighead county, Arkansas.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="FIG_91" src="images/fig_91.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 91.</span>&mdash;Muller, showing polished surface.</p>
</div>

<h4 id="HAMMERSTONES"><span class="smcap">Hammerstones.</span></h4>

<p>Hammers or hammerstones show every stage of work, from the
ordinary pebble or fragment, with its surface scarcely altered, to the
highly polished round or ovoid ‚Äúball.‚Äù They are usually of the hardest
available material, and seem to be of more frequent occurrence in
the northern districts than in the southern states, though found everywhere.
Used in their earlier stages merely as tools with which to fashion
other implements, they were assigned to specified purposes when
brought to a better finish or form. A typical example, shown in <a href="#FIG_92">figure
92</a>, is of granite, from Ross county, Ohio.</p>

<p>The Sioux used an oval stone, with a piece of rawhide covering all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
but the point and attaching it to a withe handle,<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> while the Shoshoni
and Ojibwa made use of a round stone, wrapped in leather, attached
by a string of 2 inches to a handle 22 inches long covered with
leather; this was called a poggamoggan.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a>
Rounded stones are said to
have been used by the California
Indians as bolas,<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> though it is more
probable that they were slung-shots.
The ancient Californians worked out
a round stone for an acorn-sheller;
the present Indians use any smooth
stone.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> Elaborately carved round
stones, mounted in handles as clubs,
are known to have been used by the
Queen Charlotte Island Indians for
killing fish,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> and other northwestern
Indians have been observed to use a round stone inclosed in a net and
attached to a line as a sinker.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="FIG_92" src="images/fig_92.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 92.</span>&mdash;Hammerstone.</p>
</div>

<p>It is not necessary to quote references to the well-known fact that
the Eskimo and the Patagonians made use of round stones of various
sizes as bolas. There is no evidence that our Indians ever used anything
of the sort.</p>

<h4 id="GROOVED_STONES_OTHER_THAN_AXES"><span class="smcap">Grooved Stones Other Than Axes.</span></h4>

<p>Three subclasses of grooved stones, differing in essential features
from axes, may be discriminated. They are as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="FIG_93" src="images/fig_93.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 93.</span>&mdash;Grooved round stone.</p>
</div>

<p><i>A.</i> Slightly or not at all worked, except the groove; often showing
marks of violent usage. With these may
be classed the large stone hammers of
the Lake Superior region.</p>

<p><i>B.</i> Round or ellipsoid stones; in the
latter the groove may follow either axis.
The type (figure 93) is of sandstone from
Carter county, Tennessee.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> Resembling axes in all but the edge.
Of class <i>A</i> there are none in the collection;
their form and size are such that
they could have been for no other purpose than hammerstones. Of
class <i>B</i> there are some from Savannah, which may be sinkers or club
heads. According to Morgan, oval stones with grooves were secured
in the heads of war clubs,<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> and Carver observed that the southwestern
Indians used as a slung-shot a curiously worked stone, with a string a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
yard and a half long tied to it, the other end being tied to the arm
above the elbow.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

<p>The specimens of class <i>C</i> may be broken axes. <a href="#FIG_94">Figure 94</a> (granite,
from Butler county, Ohio) shows a form quite common throughout central
and western Ohio. They are generally small, have evidently never
been sharp, and were in all probability intended for hammers from the
beginning.</p>

<h4 id="MORTARS"><span class="smcap">Mortars.</span></h4>

<p>The Indian mortars in the collection are nearly always of sandstone
of varying degrees of fineness. As is the case with cupped stones,
when made of slabs, both sides have been worked; when of rough
blocks, only one.</p>

<p>The Senecas and Cayugas are said by Morgan to have used wooden
mortars in which to pound corn after it was hulled,<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> and it is possible
that the long pestles of soft stone were used with
wooden mortars, though some are not well adapted
to this use. The Iroquois women pounded in stone
mortars the stony material used in tempering the
clay for their pottery.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> The California Indians
made mortars by knocking a segment off a bowlder,
making a flat surface, and working out with a
hammer and chisel,<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> while the tribes of the interior
worked directly from the surface of a suitable rock.
The Yokuts, according to Powers, use tolerably well made stone mortars,
and sometimes place a basket-like arrangement around the top
to prevent the acorns from flying out.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="FIG_94" src="images/fig_94.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 94.</span>&mdash;Grooved hammer.</p>
</div>

<p>No two specimens of the mortars and metate-like stones in the Bureau
collection are alike; the nearest approach that can be made to a
classification is as follows:</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Smooth and flat on one or both sides; for use with mullers; from
McMinn county, Tennessee, and Allamakee county, Iowa.</p>

<p><i>B.</i> With round cavities on one or both sides; for round or cylindrical
pestles; from McMinn county, Tennessee. A cobblestone from Bradley
county, Tennessee, has a shallow cavity in either side and a pit in the
center of each. From Kanawha valley there is a slab weighing about
25 pounds, flat and smooth on one side, as though primarily used with
a muller and the regular even cavity afterward made; on the other
side a cavity and a cupped hole have been worked in from the natural
surface. A slab from Warren county, Ohio, has a shallow cavity worked
into one side and a cupped hole in the other. From Union county,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
Mississippi, there is a flattened bowlder with a shallow cavity on each
side; a shallow cup has been pecked on the edge of one of them. From
Caldwell county, North Carolina, comes a bowlder of water-worn mica-schist,
with a shallow cavity and a deeper one on one side, and on the
other a cupped hole opposite each of these cavities.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> With one side hollowed out, the other flat and smooth. Specimens
of this type come from Caldwell county, North Carolina; McMinn
county, Tennessee, and Bradley county, Tennessee, the last with a pit
in the center and another on the edge of the flat side.</p>

<p><i>D.</i> With a long, narrow depression on each side. A very large
specimen of fine-grained sandstone from Lincoln county, Arkansas,
represents this type.</p>

<p>There are, in addition, two pieces of fine-grained sandstone with uniform
thickness of less than an inch and about 10 inches across, from
Kanawha valley, West Virginia, and Hale county, Alabama, respectively.
Both sides are ground perfectly smooth, and flat. The objects
were probably for some culinary purpose.</p>

<h4 id="SINKERS"><span class="smcap">Sinkers.</span></h4>

<p>The sinkers in the collection may be divided into four classes, viz:
<i>A</i>, entirely unworked; <i>B</i>, notched on the sides; <i>C</i>, encircled by a
groove; and <i>D</i>, perforated. Conversely, stones under all these different
heads may have served other and widely different purposes.</p>

<p>Of the functions of class <i>A</i>, only those who have seen them in use can
speak. Stevens mentions that some tribes inclose a round stone in a
sort of net and attach it to a line in fishing;<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> and no other use can be
imagined for some of the specimens in the Bureau collection.</p>

<p>Specimens of class <i>B</i> are found along water courses in such situations
as to leave no doubt of their use as sinkers;<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> they were attached to
grapevines and dragged on the bottom of streams to frighten fish into
nets or traps.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> Those in the collection are made of ordinary flat water-worn
pebbles, with notches rudely chipped in the sides; a number are
from southeastern Tennessee.</p>

<p>Of class <i>C</i>, while many were perhaps sinkers, more were club heads
and slungshots or hammers. A number have been obtained from Savannah,
Georgia, more or less worked, some being rounded, with grooves
of varying depths and sizes. Small stones of this form are used by
Greenland fishermen as sinkers;<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> and according to Thatcher, a large
stone is by the Indians made fast to a sinking line at each end of a net,
and the net is spread in the water by sinkers at different parts of it.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></p>

<p>Class <i>D</i> will be referred to under the head ‚ÄúPerforated stones,‚Äù from
which they can be discriminated only arbitrarily.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span></p>

<p>A number of roughly chipped, somewhat crescent-shaped specimens
of argillite, from half a pound to 2 pounds in weight, collected in Montgomery
county, North Carolina, may have been used as sinkers.</p>

<h4 id="PERFORATED_STONES"><span class="smcap">Perforated Stones.</span></h4>

<p>Only the larger or rougher perforated stones used as implements are
included in this class.</p>

<p>Several perforated pieces of steatite, some mere rough fragments,
others with the edges smooth and dressed to a somewhat symmetrical
outline, have been collected about Savannah, Georgia. Some of
these have been drilled, others gouged through apparently with a
slender flint. In the latter group the little projections left by the tool
have been worn smooth. The hole may be near one end or about the
center. Similar pieces have been found in Forsyth county, Georgia;
one of these is worked to an irregular pentagon and smoothly finished.
From Haywood county, North Carolina, there are some very rough
fragments, apparently just as they were picked up, except for the
perforation; and a number of pieces of perforated pottery are from
Montgomery county, North Carolina.</p>

<p>Perforated stones were used by the southern Indians to drag along
the bottoms of streams and frighten fish into their nets and traps.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a>
Four disks 4 to 5&frac12; inches in diameter, with handles from 13 to 17 inches
long, were found in a cave at Los Angeles, California,<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> and objects of this
character were, according to Schumacher, used by the Santa Barbara
Indians as weights for wooden spades.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> According to Abbott many
perforated stones are found close to rivers and on shores in such positions
as to leave no doubt of their use as sinkers.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> Similar stones were
used as sinkers by the Scandinavians in comparatively recent times;
by the Bechuanas for grinding grasshoppers, spiders, etc., and also as
weights for digging-sticks; by some savages in the Pacific islands as
clubs; by the Icelanders for breaking up salted fish.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> They were used
by the Iroquois as weights for fire drills;<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> by the Eskimo as clubs,
having a rawhide handle secured by a knot.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> According to Dale,<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a>
Layard,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> Griesbach,<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> and Gooch,<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> they were used by natives of
southern Africa as root-diggers (to remove earth from the roots), as
weapons, and to give weight to digging-sticks. They were also used
by the Peruvian Indians to be thrown with a stick. Disk-shaped and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
cylindrical throwing stones, perforated for the stick, are found among
the Swiss lake dwellings.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> According to Evans<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> they were used
mostly as hammers or clubs. They are hard and battered on the edges;
sinkers would be of softer stone.</p>

<p>The most complete article that has yet been given concerning the
forms and uses of perforated stones is that by H. W. Henshaw.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></p>

<h4 id="DISCOIDAL_STONES"><span class="smcap">Discoidal Stones.</span></h4>

<p>There are numerous references to discoidal stones by various writers,
but a majority of the objects do not fall under any explanation that has
so far been given.</p>

<p>The Choctaw Indians used disks two fingers wide and two spans
around in playing ‚Äúchungke,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> and the Indians of North Carolina were
much addicted to a sport called ‚Äúchenco,‚Äù played with a staff and a
bowl made with stone.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> The same kind of game was, or still is, played
with hoops or rings of wood or rawhide by the Iroquois,<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> the Pawnee,<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a>
the Apache,<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> the Navajo,<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> the Mohave,<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> and the Omaha;<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> also, with
rings of stone, by the Arikara,<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> the Mandan,<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> and other tribes.</p>

<p>The game of chungke, however, will account for only a small part of
the great number of stones of this form. The Indians of southern
California, in manufacturing pottery, make the clay compact and smooth
by holding a rounded and smooth stone against the inside.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> The Fijians,
in making pottery, use a small, round flat stone to shape the inside,<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a>
while the Indians of Guiana use ancient axes or smooth stones for polishing
the clay in making their vessels.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> According to Evans,<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> pitted
disks were used as pestles, hammers, or mullers; a thick one with
pitted ends was found in a mortar at Holyhead.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> Under the head of
pestles and of perforated stones further references will be found that
may apply as well to this form of implements.</p>

<p>No kind of relic is more difficult to classify. From the smooth, symmetrical,
highly-polished chungke stone they gradually merge into
mullers, pestles, pitted stones, polishers, hammers,<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> ornaments, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
the ordinary sinker or club-head, so that no dividing line is possible.
Theories constructed on a basis of their use may be far from correct.</p>

<p>They present various forms and degrees of finish; many have the
natural surface on both sides with the edge worked off by grinding or
pecking, the latter being produced probably by use as a hammer; the
sides may be ground down while the edge remains untouched; or the
sides may be pecked and the edge ground, being probably of a thick
pebble originally. Some of the finer grades, as chalcedony and quartz,
that have received the highest finish, appear to have had all the work
done by grinding or rubbing, as even those only slightly worked bear
no signs of hammering or pecking. When of the harder materials
they are generally made of water-worn pebbles as nearly the desired
form as can be found; in fact, some specimens which are in their natural
state, entirely unworked, require a very close examination to distinguish
them from others whose whole surface has been artificially produced.
In the jasper conglomerates from Arkansas, however, there is a
regular series from a roughly chipped disk to one of the highest polish
and symmetry. The larger ones of quartz, particularly those with concavities
in the sides, must have been patiently wrought for years before
brought to their present state. Many of the smaller ones, especially
sandstone, seem to have been designed for grinding or polishing.</p>

<img id="FIG_95" src="images/fig_95.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 95.</span>&mdash;Discoidal stone.</p>
</div>

<p>The following groups are represented in the collection:</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Sides hollowed out, edge convex; 2 to 6 inches diameter, seven-eighths
to 2&frac34; thick.</p>

<p>1. Edges of concavity sharp.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> Cavity a regular curve from side to side. The type (<a href="#FIG_95">figure 95</a>) is of
quartz, from Cherokee county, Georgia. There are also, from Kanawha
valley, West Virginia, one of sandstone, of which one side has been
worked out by a flint, the little pits being distinctly visible, while the
other side has natural surface; from Loudon county, Tennessee, one of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
quartzite, 6 inches diameter, which has been used as a mortar, the cavities
being roughened, with their edges broken and scarred (the edge of
the stone is battered entirely around midway between the sides as
though used for a hammer); from McMinn county, Tennessee, one of
quartzite, about the same size as last, with a slight pit in the center of
each cavity, the edges of the concavity being considerably chipped, and
the edge of the implement very smooth; from Polk county, Tennessee,
one of quartzite, 3&frac12; inches in diameter, with the edge polished except in
one spot, where it shows marks of use as a hammer or pestle&mdash;it has been
used also as a mortar, the edges of the concavity being much chipped
and broken; one each from Craighead county, Arkansas, of novaculite;
Randolph county, Illinois, of granite; Cherokee county, Georgia,
of quartz; and Obion county, Tennessee, of sandstone. In the four
last mentioned the entire surface
is quite smooth or even highly polished.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 96.</span>&mdash;Discoidal stone, with perforation.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> With a small perforation at the
center. The type is shown in <a href="#FIG_96">figures
96</a> (of sandstone, from a grave in
Union county, Illinois), and <a href="#FIG_97">97</a> (of
granite, from Virginia). There is
another specimen, of sandstone, from
Red River county, Texas.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 97.</span>&mdash;Discoidal stone, with perforation.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> With a secondary depression in
each cavity. <a href="#FIG_98">Figure 98</a> (yellow
quartz, highly polished, from Fulton
county, Georgia) is typical. There
is also one of quartzite, with a secondary depression in one side only,
from Roane county, Tennessee, which may be supposed, from this and
other imperfections, to be unfinished.</p>

<p>2. Edges of concavity rubbed off blunt. These are grouped simply
by form, as the specimens from Kanawha valley, West Virginia, and
northeastern Kentucky are nearly all roughly finished, quite different
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
from the smooth or polished ones from farther south. Some are worked
out into the form of a ring, and there is every stage between that form
and the flat disk whose sides show no trace of pecking. <a href="#FIG_99">Figure 99</a>
(quartzite, from Sevier county, Tennessee) illustrates a typical example,
roughly worked but entirely perforated, and <a href="#FIG_97">figure 97</a> shows the same
type in another form.</p>

the entire surface; some are rubbed more or less on the edges or sides,
but a majority have the edge rough as it was chipped or pecked out;
many have either the edge or sides in the natural state. From those
smoothly polished to those very rudely worked the gradation is such
that no dividing line can be drawn. This is true, also, of the smaller
specimens of other types. Some of the quartzite specimens are very
loose in texture. From seven-eighths to 2 inches in diameter and one-fourth

<p><i>M.</i> Edges V-shape; 1&frac34; to 2&frac12; inches diameter, 1 to 1&frac12; inches thick.
The type (<a href="#FIG_105">figure 105</a>) is of granite, from Randolph county, Illinois, with
insunk pecked sides and polished edge. A specimen from Kanawha
valley, West Virginia, is of flint, with only the edge worked; apparently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
a hammer. One from Craighead county, Arkansas, has flat sides
and the entire surface polished; another from McMinn county, Tennessee,
is also polished entire. A good specimen
from Cocke county, Tennessee, is of
flint, one side rubbed flat, the other a
rounded cone, highly polished.</p>

<p><i>N.</i> Sides hollowed out; edges straight or
slightly curved; very thick; used as mortars,
hammers, or pestles. This form gradually
merges into disk-shaped, pitted, or
entire dressed hammers, which in turn run
into the ordinary hammerstones. The types are figures 106 (quartzite,
from Bradley county, Tennessee) and 107 (quartzite, from Nicholas
county, Kentucky). There are in this
group from eastern Tennessee three of
quartzite, 2&frac14; by 4&frac12; inches, 4&frac14; by 5&frac34;
inches, and 1&frac34; by 3&frac14; inches, and one
of granite, 2&frac34; by 3 inches; from Caldwell
county, North Carolina, one of
granite; and from Montgomery county,
North Carolina, three of quartzite.
The last four are evidently hammers
or pestles. In addition there is a specimen
from Jackson county, Illinois, of
ferruginous sandstone, 3 inches in
diameter. On one side there is a pit and on the other a shallow, mortar-like
cavity extending entirely across.</p>

<p><i>O.</i> One side flat, the other rounded; of convenient
size for grasping. In some the bottom is
quite smooth. There is sometimes a pit in one or
both sides, more frequently in the bottom. They
were used as mullers or pestles; in the latter, either
the side or the edge may have been the pounding
surface. The line between these implements and
the cylindrical, dome-topped pestles can not be drawn (see <a href="#FIG_91">figure 91</a>).</p>

are many disk-shape fragments of pottery, small, thin, and coarse,

northeastern Kentucky there are similar
pieces, except that they have been fashioned
from fragments of limestone and sandstone.

<h4 id="SPUDS"><span class="smcap">Spuds.</span></h4>

<p>It has been a puzzle to archeologists to
assign to any class the peculiar stones
called ‚Äúspuds.‚Äù They are usually of a
comparatively soft material, carefully worked and polished, and bear no
marks of rough usage. On the other hand, they seem too large for
ornament. Perhaps their office may have been in some ceremony or
game. Something similar in form seems to be denoted in the following
extracts:</p>

<p>Col. James Smith<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> says, speaking of the Indians of western Pennsylvania,
that as soon as the elm bark will strip in spring, the squaws,
after finding a tree that will do, cut it down, and with a crooked stick,
broad and sharp at the end, take the bark off the tree, and of this bark
make vessels. The Twana Indians, who formerly lived at the south
end of Hoods canal, Washington, in barking logs use a heavy iron
implement about 3 feet long, widened and sharpened at the end;<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> and
the tanbark workers of our day use an instrument of somewhat similar
form.</p>

<p>The ordinary spud is too weak to endure such usage, though it is
claimed by old people living in the Shenandoah valley, Virginia, that
in the last century the Indians in that locality used an implement of
this pattern for stripping the bark from trees. The implement may
have been used in dressing hides, the hole being for attachment of a
handle.

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="FIG_109" src="images/fig_109.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 109.</span>&mdash;Spud.</p>
</div>

<p>A celt of argillite, highly polished, from Loudon county, Tennessee,
of the pattern shown in <a href="#FIG_64">figure 64</a>, has a neatly
drilled cylindrical hole about a third of the
way from the top; but such cases are unusual.
The spuds may be divided into three general
classes, as follows:</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Blade circular in outline, including 180
degrees or more, or semielliptical with either
axis transverse; sides of stem straight or
slightly curved, parallel or slightly tapering
to top, which is either straight or slightly
rounded; shoulder nearly at right angles to
stem, with sharp or rounded corners or sometimes
barbed; stem and blade not differing
greatly in length. The type of the class,
presented in <a href="#FIG_109">figure 109</a>, is of clay slate, from
a mound in Monroe county, Tennessee. The other six specimens in the
collection were distributed as shown in the table.</p>

<p><i>B.</i> Lower part of the blade a half circle or less; top square or slightly
rounded; stem rapidly widening, with increasing curve to the blade,
making an angle with it; stem and blade
nearly the same length. A specimen of
green slate, from Mississippi county, Arkansas,
is illustrated in <a href="#FIG_110">figure 110</a>. Another,
of compact quartzite, comes from
Loudon county, Tennessee.</p>

shoulders. Illustrated in <a href="#FIG_111">figure 111</a> (probably
of chloritic slate, from Prairie county,
Arkansas).</p>

<h4 id="PLUMMETS"><span class="smcap">Plummets.</span></h4>

<p>The specimens known as plummets vary
considerably in form, size, and degree of
finish, indicating diversity of purpose, and different writers have
assigned to them various uses.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span></p>

<p>According to Abbott, one of these relics was found at Salem, in a
mortar.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> Stevens says, quoting from Schoolcraft, that the Pennacook
Indians used sinkers very much like a plummet in shape.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> In Florida
very rough plummets with deep grooves are found in the shell mounds,
which were no doubt used as sinkers. The Indians of
southern California use them as medicine stones to
bring rain; the Eskimo use similar stones as sinkers,
but have them perforated at the end. The larger objects
of this form may have been used as pestles.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> They
might be made very efficient in twisting thread, as they
revolve for a considerable time when set in motion.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="FIG_111" src="images/fig_111.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 111.</span>&mdash;Spud.</p>
</div>

<p>The general form is ovoid, sometimes quite slender,
sometimes almost round; the ends
may be either blunt or pointed.
They may be grooved near the middle
or near either the larger or
smaller end. Some have two grooves,
some are only partially grooved,
while others have the groove extending
lengthwise. There are forms
that differ somewhat from this description,
but such are rare.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 113.</span>&mdash;Plummet,

</div>

<p>Many small and otherwise unworked
waterworn pebbles and
pieces of steatite pots from southeastern
Tennessee and from Montgomery county, North
Carolina, have grooves near the middle or near one end;
they were probably applied to some of the
uses for which plummets were intended.</p>

<p>The plummets in the Bureau collection
may be grouped as follows:</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Grooved near smaller end. The types
are illustrated in <a href="#FIG_112">figure 112</a> (sandy limestone,
from a mound in Catahoula parish,
Louisiana), and <a href="#FIG_113">figure 113</a> (hematite, double
grooved, with notches cut in various places,
from a mound in Kanawha valley, West
Virginia). Other specimens are, one from
Arkansas county, Arkansas, of sandstone,
and one each from Brown and Randolph counties, Illinois,
both of hematite.</p>

<p><i>B.</i> Grooved near larger end. A good example, of hematite,
is from Kanawha valley, West Virginia, with a second groove partially
around the middle.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span></p>

<p><i>C.</i> Grooved near the middle. The class is represented by a beautiful
specimen (<a href="#FIG_114">figure 114</a>) of hematite, with the groove much polished
and irregular, and a deep notch cut in one end, from Ross county, Ohio.
Another specimen, from Kanawha valley, West Virginia,
is a double conical implement of hematite, elliptical in section
with both ends ground off on flatter sides only.</p>

of hematite, much
shorter than the Yellowstone
specimen and
with blunt ends, from

with one end perforated, from Yellowstone park; another, from Randolph
county, Illinois, of hematite, rough, perhaps unfinished.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Double cone, with one end ground off flat and hollowed
out. The type (<a href="#FIG_117">figure 117</a>) is of granite,
one of three from Savannah, Georgia.</p>

<p><i>G.</i> Top flattened and hollowed out;
sides incurving to the middle; lower
half a hemisphere. The class is represented
by <a href="#FIG_118">figure 118</a> (quartzite, from
Randolph county, Illinois), and <a href="#FIG_119">figure

<p><i>H.</i> Ovoid, with the smaller end ground off flat.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> A good specimen of
this class (<a href="#FIG_120">figure 120</a>) is of magnetite,
from Caldwell county, North Carolina.
From Savannah, Georgia, there are two
of sandstone, both smaller than the
type and rough; from Kanawha valley
there is one of quartzite, nearly half
ground away, leaving almost a hemisphere;
and from eastern Tennessee
there are one of magnetite and one of
quartzite, the latter nearly round.</p>

from a mound in Loudon county, Tennessee,
is illustrated in <a href="#FIG_121">figure 121</a>. It
is of sandstone; a short cylinder with
incurved sides, each end terminating in a blunt cone.

<p><a href="#FIG_122">Figure 122</a> represents a piece of smoothly dressed steatite from Desha
county, Arkansas, with a two-thirds round section, the ends rounded,
with a groove near one end, which may be classed with the plummets.
There are pieces of sandstone from the same locality which connect this
pattern with the simpler ‚Äúboat-form‚Äù stones, except that the flat side
is ground smooth instead of being hollowed.
This is only one of numerous
examples where the shapes of implements
whose ‚Äútypical forms‚Äù seem utterly
dissimilar merge into one another
so gradually that no line of demarkation
can be drawn.</p>

<p>The relics known as ‚Äúcones‚Äù have the
base flat and the side curving slightly;
usually the curve extends regularly
over the top, but sometimes the apex is
rubbed off flat. The conic surface may
form an angle with the base, or the line of junction may be rounded into
a curve. They vary considerably in thickness, some being nearly flat,
others having a height equal to the diameter of the base. One of steatite
from Savannah, as also one of sandstone from Kanawha valley, has a
slight pit or depression on the flat side. Among the best examples are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>

<h4 id="HEMISPHERES"><span class="smcap">Hemispheres.</span></h4>

<p>Hemispheric stones, like the cones,
can receive a name only from the form
and not from any known or imagined
use to which they could have been applied.</p>

<p>All such specimens in the collection,
except one, are from Kanawha
valley, and of hematite; many if not
most of them have been ground down
from the nodule, and were probably
paint stones originally; at least, the
material rubbed from them was used
as paint while the maker had their
final form in view. One, however, has
been pecked into shape and is entirely
without polish. In all, the base
is flat and varies in outline from
almost a circle to a narrow ellipse.
A section of the stone parallel to
either axis of the base varies from a
little more to a little less than a semicircle.
Typical forms, both from Bracken county, Kentucky, are illustrated
in <a href="#FIG_127">figure 127</a>.</p>

<p>The specimen, illustrated in <a href="#FIG_128">figure 128</a> (yellow quartz, from a mound
in Kanawha valley) is intermediate between cones and hemispheres.
The sides are polished, while the flat bottom and
rounded top are roughened. As it has faint red
stains, it may have been used as a paint-muller.</p>

<h4 id="PAINT_STONES"><span class="smcap">Paint Stones.</span></h4>

<p>The articles known as paint stones scarcely come
under the head of implements. Some of the hematite
pieces are incipient celts, hemispheres, or cones; but most of them
were used merely to furnish paint, at any rate until rubbed down quite
small. They are of every degree of firmness,
some being as brittle as dry clay, others like
iron. Most pieces in the collection are from
Kanawha valley, but others are from southeastern
Tennessee, northeastern Arkansas, and
Caldwell county, North Carolina. From the
last-named section, as well as from Chester
county, South Carolina, and McMinn county,
Tennessee, come pieces of graphite more or less rubbed; and one has
been sent in from Elmore county, Alabama.</p>

<p>The specimen illustrated in <a href="#FIG_129">figure 129</a>, from a mound, is a good
example of the manner in which the harder hematite was ground.</p>

<h4 id="CEREMONIAL_STONES"><span class="smcap">Ceremonial Stones.</span></h4>

<h5 id="FUNCTIONS_AND_PURPOSES"><span class="smcap">Functions and Purposes.</span></h5>

<p>The so-called ‚Äúceremonial stones‚Äù are variously subdivided and
named by different writers. They are supposed to have been devoted
to religious, superstitious, medical, emblematic, or ceremonial purposes;
to be badges of authority, insignia of rank, tokens of valorous deeds,
or perhaps some sort of heraldic device; in short, the uses to which
they might, in their different forms, be assigned, are limited only by
the imagination.</p>

<p>According to Nilsson the ancient Scandinavians wore ‚Äúvictory stones‚Äù
suspended around their necks,<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> and the Eskimo wear charms and
amulets to bring success in fishing and hunting.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> Adair (1775) says
that the American Archi-magus wore a breastplate made of a white
conch-shell, with two holes bored in the middle of it, through which he
put the ends of an otter-skin strap and fastened a buck-horn button to
the outside of each.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> An explanation of the purpose of many of the
smaller perforated stones also may be found in Nilsson‚Äôs remark<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> that
the small ovoid or ellipsoid ones were used as buttons; a string being
tied to the robe at one end, run through the hole and tied in a knot.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span></p>

<p>The various Indians of Guiana in their leisure hours often fashion
highly ornamental weapons and implements which they never use
except ceremonially, but keep proudly at home for show.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a></p>

<p>So, too, the Yurok and Hupa Indians of California, as well as some
of the tribes of Oregon, have very large spearheads or knives, which
are not designed for use, but only to be produced on the occasion of a
great dance. The larger weapons are wrapped in skin to protect the
hand; the smaller ones are glued to a handle. Some are said to be
15 inches long.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> The Oregon Indians believed the possession of a large
obsidian knife brought long life and prosperity to the tribe owning it.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></p>

<p>Some of the wild tribes of the interior have something which they
regard as the Jews did the Ark of the Covenant. Sometimes it is
known; again it is kept secret. The Cheyenne had a bundle of arrows;
the Ute a little stone image, and the Osage a similar stone.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> The
Kiowa had a carved wooden image, representing a human face; the
Ute captured it, and the Kiowa offered very great rewards for its
return; but the Ute, believing the Kiowa powerless to harm them so
long as it was retained, refused to give it up.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></p>

<p>The North Carolina Indians, when they went to war, carried with
them their idol, of which they told incredible stories and asked counsel;<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a>
and as a token of rank or authority, the Virginia Indians suspended
on their breasts, by a string of beads about their neck, a square
plate of copper.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> These were worn as badges of authority. The native
tribes, from our first acquaintance with them, evinced a fondness
for insignia of this kind.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a></p>

<p>Simply for convenience the ceremonial stones in the Bureau collection
will here be divided into two general classes. The first, comprising
those pierced through the shortest diameter, will be called gorgets,
which name, like that of celt, has no particular meaning, but is in common
use. The second class will comprise all others, which will have
some name that may or may not be suitable to their form, but by which
they are usually called. In this class are included boat-shape stones,
banner stones, picks, spool-shape ornaments, and bird-shape stones,
as well as engraved tablets or stones.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></p>

<h5 id="GORGETS"><span class="smcap">Gorgets.</span></h5>

<p>The relics commonly called gorgets have been found in Europe; they
may be convex on one side, concave on the other, and are supposed to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
be for bracers.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> It is said that the Miami Indians wore similar plates
of stone to protect their wrists from the bowstring.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> Herndon and
Gibbon remark that a gold ornament in shape like a gorget, but not
pierced, is worn on the forehead by some of the Amazon Indians.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a>
According to Schoolcraft the so-called gorgets were sometimes used as
twine-twisters;<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> but Abbott holds that while some may have been
twine-twisters, or may have been used for condensing sinews or evening bowstrings
(that is, reducing the strings to a uniform diameter), most were
simply ornaments, as they are generally found on the breast of a
buried body.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> Stevens is even more conservative, holding that they
were neither twine-twisters nor devices for condensing sinews or evening
bowstrings, as they show no marks of wear in the holes.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a></p>

<p>Some writers suppose the gorgets to have been shuttles; but this
supposition can hardly be entertained, although it is true, according
to Chase, that the Oregon Indians passed thread with a curved bone
needle.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> As twine-twisters they would be about as awkward as anything
that could be devised. As to evening bowstrings, it would seem
that if a string were too large in places to pass through a hole it could
not be pulled through; pounding and rolling the wet string with a
smooth stone, or some such means, would be the remedy. The bracer
theory is plausible; but no one seems ever to have seen a gorget used for
this purpose.</p>

<p>Few of the gorgets in the Bureau collection show such marks of wear
around the edges of the hole as would be made by a cord; but the
majority are thus worn at the middle, where the hole is smallest.
Some specimens among every lot are not perforated, or only partially
so; the drilling seems to have been the last stage of the work. The
hole is almost always drilled from both sides, and the few in which it
goes entirely through from one side would probably have had it
enlarged later from the other. A number are fragments of larger
gorgets, the pieces having been redrilled.</p>

<p>Some of the specimens have various notches and incised lines, the
latter being sometimes in tolerably regular order; but there is not the
slightest indication that these marks had any meaning or were intended
for any other purpose than to add to the ornamental appearance of the
stone.</p>

<p>If they were to be worn at the belt or on any part of the dress they
could easily have been fastened by a knotted string, or if the wearer
desired he could have an ornamental button of some kind. If suspended
around the neck, in order to make them lie flat against the breast they
probably had a short cord passed through the perforation and tied
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
above the top of the object, the suspending cord being passed through
the loop thus formed.</p>

<p>The principal division is into group <i>A</i> with one hole
and group <i>B</i> with two holes, though in many cases this
forms the only difference between two specimens.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> General outline rectangular, or perhaps slightly
elliptical, sometimes with one end somewhat narrower
than the other, or with one end rounded off, or with the
corners slightly rounded. Perforation commonly near
one end. The form is represented by the specimen
with two perforations illustrated in <a href="#FIG_133">figure 133</a>, which
otherwise fully answers the description. The argillite
specimens have the broader ends striated as though
used for rubbing or scraping, but in other respects conform to those of
other materials. The materials are generally the softer rocks, as shown
in the accompanying table:</p>

<p>A related type is rectangular or with incurved sides (forming either
a regular or broken curve) and rounded ends, and differs in having the
perforation near the center. The same pattern sometimes has two holes.
It is illustrated in <a href="#FIG_130">figure 130</a> (striped slate, from a mound in Kanawha

<p>There are a number of small pebbles,
thin and flat, with a hole drilled near
the edge, from southeastern Tennessee,
North Carolina, and southeastern
Arkansas. One of these, from Caldwell
county, North Carolina, is of
banded slate; the others are of clay
slate or sandstone. Two of them have
straight and zigzag lines on both faces, and notches around the edge.</p>

<p>Allied to these are a number of pieces of flat stone from southeastern
Tennessee, Kanawha valley, and North Carolina, with the faces partially
rubbed down smooth, the edges being untouched. They are of
slate, talc, or argillite.</p>

<p>From southeastern Tennessee and North Carolina there are several
pieces of steatite, which may have been for sinkers. Some have a hole
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
near one end, others a hole at each end, while still others are not perforated.
All have been worked over the entire surface, and some of
them are well polished. One of these is represented in <a href="#FIG_131">figure 131</a>.</p>

<p><i>B.</i> Gorgets with two holes.
Of these there are several subdivisions,
differing more or
less widely in form. They
are as follows:</p>

<p>1. Thick, with both the sides

faces flat or slightly
convex. This form is represented
by the specimen shown

<p>5. Same outline, but quite thick, approaching the ‚Äúboat-shape‚Äù
stones in form. In some the flat side is slightly hollowed out. A
majority of them are not perforated. The type
(<a href="#FIG_135">figure 135</a>) is of sandstone, from a mound at
Adelphi, Ohio.</p>

<p>There are also, from Butler county, Ohio,
Kanawha valley, West Virginia, and Savannah,
Georgia, one each of slate; from Ross
county, Ohio, two, and from Kanawha valley,
and Cocke county, Tennessee, one each, all of
sandstone. There are two (of sandstone and
slate) from Kanawha valley, which differ from
the others in having the sides parallel, giving
them a semicylindrical form.</p>

<p>The pattern of the specimen illustrated in
<a href="#FIG_136">figure 136</a> (striped slate, from Butler county,
Ohio, of which a number have been found in
that state), may be classed between the gorgets
and the boat-shape stones. The shorter end
of the object has, sometimes, a projection or
enlargement at the top, apparently for suspension,
although no perforated examples have
been found.</p>

<h4 id="BANNER_STONES"><span class="smcap">Banner Stones.</span></h4>

<p>Under the head of ‚Äúbanner stones‚Äù are
placed ornaments having the ends at right
angles to the perforation. The hole is drilled
in a midrib, from which the faces slope by
either straight or curved lines to the edges. The two halves of the
stone are symmetrical. In most specimens one face is flatter than the
other, even plane in some cases. Some specimens are finished to a high
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
polish, before the hole is started; others have the hole completed with the
exterior more or less unfinished. The specimens in the Bureau collection
may be classified as follows:</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Rectangular or trapezoidal, with sides and ends sometimes slightly
curved inward or outward.</p>

<p><i>B.</i> Reel-shape.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> Crescentic.</p>

<p><i>D.</i> Butterfly pattern.</p>

<p>The last three varieties may be considered as only modifications of
the simple rectangular banner stones. By rounding off the corners of
the articles or dressing them to sharp points, by cutting away portions
from the sides or by trimming away the central portions at either or
both ends of the perforations, all these different forms may be produced.</p>

was taken from a mound in Kanawha valley, West Virginia. Another
good example, shown in <a href="#FIG_138">figure 138</a>, is of sandy slate, from a grave in
Monroe county, Tennessee. The geographic range of this type is wide,
though the objects are not abundant.

<p><i>C.</i> The crescentic banner stones might better be termed ‚Äúsemilunar,‚Äù
since most of them are flat at one end and curved at the other. Occasionally
one has both ends
curved and parallel,
the sides also slightly
curved, making the
article reniform.
Others have the ends
straight and parallel,
with the sides curved
or like the zone of a
circle. Two have a
midrib for the hole,
with the sides dressed
down quite thin, as
with the butterfly gorgets. All were finished in form before the drilling
was done, though some had not received their final polish. The
type is illustrated in figures 141 (steatite, from northwestern North
Carolina), 142 (pagodite, from Rhea county, Tennessee), and 143 (sandstone,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
from Jefferson county, Tennessee). The last form is sometimes
called a perforated ax, but the material and fragile make exclude it
from every class except the ceremonial stones.</p>

a butterfly with expanded wings. The sides or wings are usually quite
thin, either semicircular or like a spherical triangle in outline. The
perforated mid-rib is shorter than the wings and carefully worked. A
good example, shown in <a href="#FIG_144">figure 144</a>, is of ferruginous quartz from

one each of steatite

<p>Relics of spool shape, probably ornamental rather than industrially
useful, are not uncommon in copper, though very rare in stone.
The specimen shown in <a href="#FIG_151">figure 151</a> is of sandstone,
from Jackson county, Arkansas. There
are also, from Prairie and Lonoke counties,
one each of sandstone, and from Jackson

<h4 id="BIRD-SHAPE_STONES"><span class="smcap">Bird-shape Stones.</span></h4>

<p>Stone relics of bird form are quite common north of the Ohio river,
but are exceedingly rare south of that stream. A good example, shown
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
in <a href="#FIG_152">figure 152</a>, is of granite, from Vernon county, Wisconsin, and the

<p>According to Gillman, bird-shape stones were worn on the head by
the Indian women, but only after marriage.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> Abbott<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> quotes Col.
Charles Whittlesey to the effect that they were worn by Indian women
to denote pregnancy, and from William Penn that when squaws were
ready to marry they wore something on their heads to indicate the fact.
Jones<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> quotes from De Bry that the conjurers among the Virginia
Indians wore a small, black bird above one of their ears as a badge of
their office.</p>

<h4 id="SHAFT_RUBBERS"><span class="smcap">Shaft Rubbers.</span></h4>

<p>The shaft of an arrow is straightened by wetting and immersing it in
hot sand and ashes, and bringing into shape by the hand and eye. To
reduce the short crooks and knobs it is drawn between two rough grit
stones, each of which has a slight groove in it; coarse sand is also used
to increase the friction.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a></p>

<p>Again, a rock has a groove cut into it as wide as the shaft and two or
three times as deep. Into this the crooked part of the shaft is forced,
and by heating or steaming becomes flexible and can be easily made
straight, which shape it will retain when dry.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></p>

<p>A somewhat different device for the same purpose appears in the
Bureau collection. It is illustrated in <a href="#FIG_153">figure 153</a> (of fine sandstone);
there was another part to correspond with that shown. The specimen

<p>As the use of stone tubes by the Indians has given rise to considerable
discussion, the following references to the various ways in which
they have been employed may help to settle it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span></p>

<p>Schoolcraft observed that the Dakota Indians used a horn tube in
bleeding; one end was set over the cut, and the other vigorously
sucked.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> Powers says that the Klamath Indians use tubes for smoking,<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a>
while H. H. Bancroft says that the Acaxees of Mexico employ
‚Äúblowing through a hollow tube‚Äù for the cure of disease,<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> and also
that the Indians of southern California inhale smoke of certain herbs
through a tube to produce intoxication.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> According to C. C. Jones the
Florida and Virginia Indians used reeds in treating diseases by sucking
or blowing through them, and also used them in cauterizing; and
he observes that the Indians of Lower California employed similar
processes, using stone tubes<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> instead of reeds. Hoffman illustrates the
removal of disease through the agency of a tube of bone by a Jƒïs&acute;sakƒ´d&acute;
or medicine-man of the Ojibwa.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> Read calls attention to the fact
that the old Spanish writers describe a forked wooden tube, the prongs
being inserted in the nostrils, while the other end was held over
smoldering herbs, and suggests that the Indians may have used stone
tubes in the same way.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="FIG_153" src="images/fig_153.jpg"  alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 153.</span>&mdash;Shaft rubber.</p>
</div>

<p>The Indian mode of inhaling smoke would produce the same result,
whether drawn through the mouth or into the nostrils.</p>

<p>The use of stone tubes for astronomical purposes,
which has been discovered by some imaginative
writers, is, of course, absurd; nevertheless they
are useful in viewing distant objects on a bright
day, especially when looking toward the sun.</p>

<p>Nearly all of the tubes made of soft material
with tapering perforation seem to have been gouged
rather than drilled. Schumacher observes that the California Indians
drilled their tubes from both ends and enlarged the hole from one end
by scraping, the mouthpiece being made of a bird bone stuck on with
asphaltum.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a></p>

<p>There are five classes of stone tubes in the collection of the Bureau,
as follows:</p>

<p><i>A.</i> One end flattened and expanding into a wing on either side.
This class is illustrated by <a href="#FIG_154">figure 154</a> (from Kanawha valley, West
Virginia). The corners of this specimen have been trimmed off; the
typical form is indicated by the dotted lines. There are also from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
same locality one of quartzite, and from Ross county, Ohio, one of
sandstone.</p>

<p><i>B.</i> Conical; the bore more tapering than the exterior. Represented
by the specimen shown in <a href="#FIG_155">figure 155</a>, of sandstone, from a mound in
Kanawha valley, West Virginia.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> Hour-glass shape, usually but not always with a narrow ring or
projection around the smallest part. Exterior
with gently curving outlines; the perforation
is usually in the form of a double
cone, with the points at the smallest part of
the tube, which may or may not be midway
between the ends. A good specimen, illustrated
in <a href="#FIG_156">figure 156</a>, is of steatite, from
Sevier county, Tennessee.</p>

beads. The collection includes specimens
from Bradley county, Tennessee, of steatite; from Savannah,
Georgia, of ferruginous sandstone; and from Union county, Mississippi,
of jasper.</p>

<h4 id="PIPES"><span class="smcap">Pipes.</span></h4>

<p>So much has been written concerning pipes that few references seem
necessary, and none will be given except from Col. R. I. Dodge, who,
after an experience of many years among the Plains Indians, says that
the latter have different pipes for different occasions, as the medicine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
pipe, peace pipe, council pipe, and a pipe for common use. Each is
sacred to its own purpose.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="FIG_156" src="images/fig_156.jpg"  alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 156.</span>&mdash;Tube, hour-glass form.</p>
</div>

<p>In an article so highly prized by its owner, great pains would be
expended to give an ornamental appearance to one which would be
used on important ceremonial occasions; and it would be carved or
worked in a manner gratifying to its maker or the one for whom it
was intended. This fact, and the statement quoted above, will explain
the great variety in form from a limited area. Still, in some sections
of the country there are certain types that prevail, and may be in
some cases peculiar to these localities; such, for instance, are the long
stemmed pipes from western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee.</p>

<p>In many pipes of soft stone the bowl is gouged out instead of drilled.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="FIG_157" src="images/fig_157.jpg"  alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 157.</span>&mdash;Tube, cylindrical.</p>
</div>

<p>The pipes in the Bureau collection embrace the following classes:</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Stem with an elliptical or somewhat triangular section; the bowl
near one end, leaving a projection in front; stem hole in long end.
The form is shown in <a href="#FIG_158">figure 158</a>. From Caldwell county, North Carolina
there are two similar pipes of steatite. Another, from Preston county,
West Virginia, differs only in having the stem hole in the short end.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="FIG_158" src="images/fig_158.jpg"  alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 158.</span>&mdash;Pipe, flat base.</p>
</div>

<p><i>B.</i> Same form of stem; no projection in front, the bottom of the
stem curving up gradually into the front of the bowl. This type is
represented by <a href="#FIG_159">figure 159</a> (of steatite, from a mound in Loudon county,
Tennessee). There are also, from Kanawha valley, West Virginia, an example of
talcose slate, and from Caldwell county, North Carolina,
one of steatite.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> Stem having a midrib in which the hole is bored. One of steatite,
from Caldwell county, North Carolina, has a prow; the others
have not. Another of steatite from Loudon county, Tennessee, has a
slender projection below the bowl, as if for a handle. The axis of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
bowl and that of the stem meet at any angle between 100&deg; and 170&deg;.
<a href="#FIG_160">Figure 160</a> represents a typical specimen, of steatite, from a mound in
Sullivan county, Tennessee. There are also, from Caldwell county,
North Carolina, and Kanawha and Preston counties, West Virginia,
one each, and from Sullivan county, Tennessee, two, all of steatite; and
there is an example from Kanawha valley, West Virginia, of material
not identified.</p>

<p><i>D.</i> With bowls and stems either round or square; very large. A
good example (<a href="#FIG_161">figure 161</a>) is of red sandstone, from southeastern Missouri;
it is the only pipe in the entire collection of the Bureau on
which is shown any attempt at ornamentation. From Jefferson county,
Tennessee, and Savannah, Georgia, there are one each, of steatite.</p>

<p><i>E.</i> Cylindrical bowl, with a square-edged groove around it near the
middle, below which the bottom has a somewhat celt like form, with
stem hole in one side. A small hole is drilled near the edge at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
bottom, probably for the purpose of suspending feathers or other ornaments.

<p><i>I.</i> Egg-shape bowl, stem hole in the side. One from Bradley
county, Tennessee, of argillaceous limestone, has a hole drilled from
end to end, but no stem hole. It may have been made so
intentionally, or the drilling may have been carried too
far and the specimen left unfinished. The type is of
barite, from Sevier county, Tennessee (shown in <a href="#FIG_167">figure

is of argillaceous limestone.</p>

shown in <a href="#FIG_168">figure 168</a>, is of
steatite, from Loudon county, Tennessee.
There are, also, from Preston county, West

<p><i>K.</i> Bowls egg-shape, but quite long and
sometimes rather pointed at the bottom; stem
hole in the side. This class includes the
following: From Savannah, Georgia; Roane
county, Tennessee; and Adams county, Ohio,
one each of sandstone; from Holt county,
Missouri, one of micaceous sandstone; from
Kanawha valley, West Virginia, one of
indurated red clay, possibly catlinite; and from Caldwell county, North

<h3 id="CHIPPED_STONE_ARTICLES"><span class="smcap">Chipped Stone Articles.</span></h3>

<h4 id="MATERIALS_AND_MANUFACTURE"><span class="smcap">Materials and Manufacture.</span></h4>

<p>The chipped implements in the Bureau collection, are nearly always
made of some form of flint or similar chalcedonic rock, as it is easily
chipped and can be brought to a keen edge or point. Sometimes
quartz, quartzite, argillite, or even a more granular rock is used; but
this is infrequent, and is due to the scarcity of the more desirable
material.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span></p>

<p>In the spades and hoes first to be considered the flaking seems to
have been by percussion mainly, if not entirely; the same method
appears to have been employed in obtaining flakes from blocks, to work
into the smaller implements. Some of the processes used in making
them will be hereinafter described.</p>

<h4 id="SPADES"><span class="smcap">Spades.</span></h4>

<p>It must be admitted that most Indians depended largely on agriculture
for subsistence; some historical works that represent them as barbarous
hunters, depending entirely on the chase, will, on the same page
perhaps, relate how Virginia and New England pioneers were saved
from starvation by supplies of corn, beans, and pumpkins obtained from
the Indians. This being the case, some method of cultivation was
necessary.</p>

<p>It is not to be inferred that ‚Äúcultivation‚Äù implies all that is now
meant by the term; the Indian seems merely to have worked the hill
in which his corn was planted and not the whole surface of the field,
a shallow hole being scooped out in which the grain was dropped, and
as the stalk became larger the dirt was heaped up around it. The
remains of many ‚ÄúIndian old fields‚Äù in various parts of the country
show this, there being no long ridges as in cornfields of the present
day, but only a great number of these detached hills. The great scarcity
of implements suitable for such work argues nothing, for in most
parts of the country stone easily worked and adapted to the purpose
is unobtainable.</p>

<p>There are a few flint deposits found in southern Illinois in which
the material occurs in nodules that can be made with even less work
than a piece of wood into suitable implements; and in the country
which may be considered as belonging to this archeologic district
the flint hoes and spades are tolerably abundant. In other portions of
the country, wood, the shoulder blades of large animals, and musselshells
perforated for attachment to a handle, were formerly used; the
shells are frequently found, but the other materials have long since
disappeared.</p>

<p>Early observations on the industries of the aborigines are significant.
Thus, according to De Forest, the Connecticut Indians used spades
rudely constructed of wood, or of a large shell fastened to a wooden
handle;<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> and Palmer<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> figures a hoe made of horn, 14 by 5 by one-fourth
inches, in a wooden handle 5 feet long, which is split and slipped over
the smaller end; such, with others of wood and stone, were used among
the Utah Indians before iron was introduced. Dawson holds that they
were probably prepared in large numbers for the planting time, when
the whole tribe mustered to till the fields, and that when the work was
over they were gathered and hidden in some safe place until the next
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
season.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> This may have been the case to some extent, but the specimens
found in these hiding places seldom have marks of use, and it is
more probable that they were the property either of persons living at
a distance or of an individual manufacturer in some particular village,
being thus concealed for safe-keeping until there was a demand for
them or, perhaps, to await a convenient time for transportation. A
sedentary tribe would have no more reason for hiding this than any
other kind of property.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The chipped implements known as spades are frequently found
buried in large numbers. Two caches were disclosed by high water in
1884, near Caseyville, Kentucky, containing, respectively, 57 and 75
specimens from 6 to 13 inches long.</p>

<p>The most common form is that having an oval or elliptical outline,
with the ends either coming to a point or rounded. Long use of those
having pointed ends would wear them off until they approached the
others in form; but so many of both patterns show no evidence of use
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
that this distinction must be considered intentional. The principal
varieties are as follows:</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Those with pointed ends. <a href="#FIG_169">Figure 169</a> represents a typical specimen

<p>A specimen from Jackson county, Illinois, has had a portion of the
edge broken squarely. The polish over this fractured surface shows
that it was long used after breaking without being rechipped to a sharp
edge. This indicates usage only in loose ground, as it evidently would
be quite difficult to force the square, broken part into a hard soil or
tough sod.</p>

<p>The specimens from Polk county, Tennessee, are pecked or chipped,
or both, and are quite roughly made. They are neither scratched nor
polished, and may be unfinished implements of some other class, though
agreeing closely with the flint spades in shape and size.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> A modification of the last form has the upper portion chipped
away along the sides until it is ovoid, with a blunt point, leaving the
lower part a regular curve. An example, shown in <a href="#FIG_171">figure 171</a>, is of
grayish brown flint, from Scott county, Missouri. There are also one
each from Mississippi county, Missouri, and Hopkins county, Kentucky,
of the same material.</p>

<p><i>D.</i> Like the above, but much shorter in ratio to the width, and with
a flatter curve. The type, <a href="#FIG_172">figure 172</a>, is of yellow flint, from a mound in
Obion county, Tennessee. There are also three from Union county, Illinois,
one of them with almost the same dimensions.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span></p>

<p><i>E.</i> Semicircular outline, with sides notched for securing the handle, as
in arrowpoints and spearheads. Represented by <a href="#FIG_173">figure 173</a>, showing a
specimen of gray flint from a mound in Mississippi county, Arkansas.
There are four additional specimens, all from Union county, Illinois.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> A related form, also notched for attachment of handle. <a href="#FIG_174">Figure 174</a>
represents an example of yellow flint, from Poinsett county, Arkansas,
the only one of this shape in the collection.</p>

<p>From Jackson county, Illinois, there is a series beginning with a
small scraper and a small scraper-like celt, and passing gradually into
the large spades or digging-tools, there being a number of intermediate
forms and sizes. Two specimens,
only 6 inches long, have the glazed
surface so characteristic of these
implements, which could have been
produced only by long-continued use
in digging.</p>

<p>From a workshop at Mill creek,
Union county, Illinois, there are a
large number of pieces in every stage
of work. Among them can be made
series of all the different types here
given, from the nodule in its natural
state to the completed implement.
Near by is a flint deposit showing
extensive aboriginal quarrying.</p>

<p>Dawson,<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> in speaking of these
implements, says: ‚ÄúThe rudest of
all rude implements, similar to the
paleoliths of Europe, were used by
the more settled and civilized agricultural
nations.‚Äù While the majority
of them are rude, simply because
there was no necessity for elaborate
work or fine finish in tools of this
class, yet there are many specimens
(as, for example, the one shown in
<a href="#FIG_171">figure 171</a>) which in symmetry and workmanship will compare favorably
with the larger specimens of other types, due regard being had to the
fact that the coarse flint of which they are usually made does not admit
of the most delicate execution.</p>

<h4 id="TURTLEBACKS"><span class="smcap">Turtlebacks.</span></h4>

<p>The singular name ‚Äúturtleback‚Äù is suggested instantly on seeing a
specimen of the class so designated by Abbott and others. As commonly
used, it refers to rude or unfinished leaf-shape implements of
any size, which may be found in great abundance almost anywhere.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
It is used here, however, to denote more especially the disks or almond-shaped
pieces of flint or chert sometimes found cached in considerable
numbers.</p>

<p>Perkins<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> records the discovery of such caches in Vermont; an exceptional
case, as they are seldom found outside of the Mississippi valley.
The southern portion of Illinois has furnished more than any other
section; those found there are almost invariably made from nodules of
bluish gray hornstone, the concentric lines being strongly marked.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a></p>

<p>The Bureau has secured a large number from southern Illinois,
ranging from 3&frac12; to 7&frac12; inches in length, some nearly circular, others
having a length nearly twice the breadth. All have secondary chipping
around the edges. Many of the larger ones and most of the
smaller have the edges more or less worn or polished in such manner
as would result from use as knives or scrapers. A typical specimen is
shown in <a href="#FIG_175">figure 175</a>.

<p>Stevens<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> denies in strongest terms that these relics are unfinished
implements, saying it is the worst possible form into which flint could
be chipped for carrying or for future work. On the other hand,
Cheever<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> says the Indians of California usually carry a pouch of
treasures, consisting of unfinished arrowheads or unworked stones, to
be slowly wrought out when they are industriously inclined. Catlin,
too, observed that the Apache sometimes carry bowlders of hornstone
a long distance to obtain material for arrowheads;<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> and according to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
im Thurn, the various Indian tribes of Guiana have each their special
manufacture and exchange with other tribes.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> Tylor says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Till lately the Patagonians, when they came on their journeys to a place where
suitable flint or obsidian was to be found, would load themselves with a supply of
lumps to chip into these primitive currier‚Äôs scrapers.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Both Jewitt<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> and Evans<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> say that stones of this character were used
as sling-stones; but there is no evidence that North American Indians
ever used slings. Speaking of similar stones, Tylor remarks:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>They were used either as knives or scrapers; with the curved side upward (or out)
there would be no danger of cutting a hide in skinning game, and they could be
used to cut up the flesh; while by putting the pointed end in the handle they could
be used as scrapers.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The smoothed edge in so many specimens substantiates the last
statement, while the theory that they are unfinished implements finds
support in the fact that nearly all the nodules from which they are
made have an ellipsoid form, and the present shape of the implement
would result from chipping away the useless weathered surface to
lessen the weight.</p>

<h4 id="MATERIALS_AND_MODES_OF_MANUFACTURE"><span class="smcap">Materials and Modes of Manufacture.</span></h4>

<p>In the remaining portion of this paper, which will treat of the smaller
chipped implements, a plan somewhat different from that of the preceding
part will be followed.</p>

<p>As already stated, these specimens are almost invariably made of
some form of flint; this term including chalcedony, basanite, jasper,
chert, hornstone, and similar rocks. So common is its use that the
term ‚Äúflints‚Äù is gradually being adopted as a name for all the different
classes of arrowheads, knives, drills, etc. The exceptions are not
numerous enough to justify separate classification, so no tables of material
will be used. Further, the great abundance of such relics in all
portions of the country makes useless any allusion to the number from
any particular locality; about the only limitation to their discovery is
the amount of time and care which one chooses to give.</p>

<p>Before entering on the description, some quotations may be given in
regard to methods of making these chipped implements.</p>

<p>According to Evans, the Mexican Indians take a piece of obsidian
in the left hand and press it firmly against the point of a small goathorn
held in the right, and by moving it gently in different directions
they chip off small flakes until the arrow is complete;<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> they also
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
cut a notch in the end of a bone, into which the edge of the flake is
inserted and a chip broken off by a sideways blow.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> According to the
same author, the Eskimo sometimes set the flake in a piece of split
wood. The arrow is roughly chipped by blows with a hammer, either
direct or with a punch interposed, and is then finished by pressing off
fine chips with a point of antler set in an ivory handle.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> Not only leaf-shape
barbed arrows, but also ones either with or without the stem,
can be produced by pressure with a point of antler; the former, however,
are the more easily made, and were probably earlier in use.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a></p>

<p>The Plains Indians lay the flat side of a flake of obsidian on a blanket,
or other yielding substance, and with a knife nick off the edges rapidly.
In their primitive state they probably used buckskin instead of the
blankets, and pointed bone or horn instead of the knife.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a></p>

<p>The Apache holds the flake or flint in his left hand, places his punch
at the point where the chip is to be broken off, and it is struck by an
assistant, thus knocking a chip from the under side; the flake is then
turned and the process repeated, until the arrow is complete. The
stone is held in the hand, as it can not be chipped on a hard substance.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a>
A punch observed by Catlin in use by these Indians was a whale tooth
6 or 7 inches long, with one round and two flat sides. The Fuegians,
according to the same authority, use a similar process and make as
fine implements.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a></p>

<p>The Eskimo make a spoon-shaped cavity in a log, lay the flake over
it, and press along the margin, first on one side and then on the other,
like setting a saw, until they form two sharp serrated edges. The
working tool is a point of antler firmly bound into a piece of ivory. The
same plan is used by widely separated peoples.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a></p>

<p>Nilsson, in chipping out gun flints with a stone hammer, found it necessary
to have the point operated on lie immediately above a point that
rested on the rock ‚Äúanvil‚Äù which he used.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a></p>

<p>The Veeard or Wiyot of California used a pair of buck-horn pincers
tied together with a thong at the point; they first hammered out the
arrowhead in the rough, and then with these pincers carefully nipped off
one tiny fragment after another.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> The Klamath cover the hand with a
piece of buckskin to keep it from being cut, and lay a flake along the
ball of the thumb, holding it firmly with the fingers. With a point of
antler from 4 to 6 inches long, they press against the edge, thus removing
scales from the opposite side; they turn the flake around and over
frequently, to preserve symmetry.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span></p>

<p>The Shasta Indian lays a stone anvil on his knee, holds the edge of
the flake against it, and with his stone hammer chips off flakes, finishing
the base first, and gently chipping the whole arrow into shape.
Both obsidian and glass are used.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> The Shoshoni Indians used the
same process.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a></p>

<p>A Pit River Indian has been seen to make a very sharp and piercing
arrow from a piece of quartz, with only a piece of round bone, one
end of which was hemispherical with a small crease in it (as if made by
a thread) one-sixteenth of an inch deep. The arrow was made by
pressing off flakes by main strength, the crease being to prevent the
bone from slipping, and affording no leverage.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> John Smith (1607) says
of the Powhatan Indian:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>His arrowhead he maketh quickly, with a little bone, of any splint of stone or
glass.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The Cloud River Indian used two deer prongs, one much smaller than
the other, the points ground to the form of a square, sharp-pointed
file. He had also some pieces of iron wire tied to sticks and ground in
the same manner; these were better than the deer horn, because harder,
and not needing to be sharpened so often. The flake was held firmly
in the left hand, guarded by a piece of buckskin; he pressed off chips
with the larger tool, turning the arrow end-for-end when done on one
side, so as to keep the edge opposite the middle line. The notches for
barbs were worked out in a similar manner with the smaller tool.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></p>

<p>Some of the California Indians prefer agate and obsidian for their
implements, as the close grain admits more careful working. They use a
tool with its working edge shaped like a glazier‚Äôs diamond (apparently a
piece of bone or antler with a square-cut notch on the side); the flake is
held in the left hand, while the nick in the side of the tool is used to chip
small fragments.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> Peale makes similar statements, and adds that the
notches are of different sizes to suit the different stages of work.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a></p>

<p>The Klamath Indians, according to Schumacher, have a slender stick
1&frac12; feet long, with a piece of sea-lion tooth, or antler, fastened to the
end of it. Holding one end under the arm to steady it, they take a
flake in the left hand, wrapped in a piece of buckskin so as to leave only
the edge exposed, and by pressure with the point of the tool break off
flakes as large as necessary, the last being quite fine, to give sharp edges
to the arrow. The notches are worked out by means of a point of bone
4 or 5 inches long, without a shaft.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> Chase gives a similar account,
but says that iron points have now taken the place of the bone or horn
points formerly used.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span></p>

<p>It may not be out of place in this connection to give a few quotations
in regard to the length of time required for making an arrowhead.</p>

<p>According to the Marquis de Nadaillac, the Mexicans could turn out
a hundred flint knives (probably only unworked obsidian flakes) an
hour,<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> while Crook says that the Plains Indians with only a knife for
nicking off the edges, will make from fifty to one hundred arrows in
the same period.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> Chase found that a Klamath Indian required five
minutes to complete a perfect arrowhead;<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> though Stevens observes
that a Shasta Indian spent an hour in chipping one from a flake of
obsidian,<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> and Lubbock states that the most skillful Indian workmen
can not hope to complete more than a single arrow in a day‚Äôs hard
work.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> Powers also speaks of the aborigines of California as "using
that infinite patience which is characteristic of the Indian, spending
days, perhaps weeks, upon a single piece;<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> and Tylor notes ‚Äúthat
utter disregard of time that lets the Indian spend a month in making
an arrow.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a></p>

<p>The last two references are probably to the large and finely worked
pieces used for ceremonial or ornamental purposes.</p>

<h4 id="CLASSIFICATION_OF_THE_IMPLEMENTS"><span class="smcap">Classification of the Implements.</span></h4>

<p>The only practicable division of the greater part of the smaller flints
is into stemmed and stemless, the former having a prolongation at
the base for firmer attachment to a shaft or handle, the latter being of
a triangular or oval shape. The stemmed implements may be barbed
or not, and the stem either narrower or broader toward the end.</p>

<p>The name ‚Äúarrowhead‚Äù so commonly applied, fits only the minority
of specimens, as none but the smaller ones could be so used; the larger
are too heavy. The longest stone arrowpoint in the extensive collection
of arrows in the National Museum measures two and five-eighths inches
in length and is narrow and thin. An arrowpoint two inches in length
is seldom seen. The larger specimens were probably knives and spearheads;
but it would be difficult to assign any certain use for a particular
type, the markings on so many indicate usage for which their shape
would seem to render them unsuitable. It is probable that a single
specimen served a variety of purposes.</p>

<p>Wood, bone, and shell were also used to a considerable extent, in
the manufacture of implements for which flint would seem much better
adapted. Thus for fish spears the southern Indians used canes, sharp-pointed,
barbed, and hardened in the fire,<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> while knives were formerly
made of flint or cane; these are still used when the hunting knife has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
been lost.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> The California Indians had arrows tipped with hard-pointed
wood for common use, and with agate or obsidian for war.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a></p>

<p>The accompanying diagram (<a href="#FIG_176">figure 176</a>) will render plain the different
terms used in the following descriptions:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
    <img id="FIG_176" src="images/fig_176.jpg" alt="" />

    <i>m</i> Barb, or shoulder.<br /></p></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The only difference between barb and shoulder is that the barb is
prolonged toward the base. The shoulder is called squared or rounded
according to whether the edge of the implement makes an angle or a
curve where drawn in to form the stem.</p>

<p>In the stemless specimens the base is the end opposite the point.</p>

<p>A tapering stem means one narrowing toward the base; straight, one
whose sides are parallel; and expanding, one which is widest at the base.</p>

<h4 id="STEMLESS_FLINTS"><span class="smcap">Stemless Flints.</span></h4>

<h5 id="CHARACTERS_AND_USES">CHARACTERS AND USES.</h5>

<p>The stemless flints are triangular or oval in outline. For convenience
they will be divided into those small enough for arrowpoints (not above
2&frac12; inches long) and those which are too large for such purpose. The
latter reach to the length of 7&frac12; inches. They are chipped to a sharp
edge all around. The ratio of width to length varies from 1:4 to 4:5.</p>

<p>These objects were mostly for use as knives, scrapers or spearheads.
Some of the thicker ones were spikes for clubs. Abbott<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> mentions three
triangular jasper implements 3 to 4 inches long from graves, associated
with fragments of large bones which showed plainly that they had
been used for clubs, and the Iroquois are known to have used a club
with a sharp-pointed deer-horn about four inches long inserted in the
lower side. Schoolcraft<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> illustrates a pointed stone with a square
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
section (apparently of the class usually called ‚Äúpicks‚Äù), mounted in a
club which is curved at the end to let the spike set in the end at a right
angle to the handle; and Brickell observes that the North Carolina
Indians used clubs or long poles, in the ends of which were fastened
artificially sharpened stones, or horns of animals.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> Morgan also notes
that among the Iroquois rows of arrow-shaped chert heads about two
feet in extent have been found lying side by side. They were set in a
frame and fastened with thongs, forming a species of sword.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> According
to Tylor the Mexicans had a similar sword, with obsidian teeth
gummed in holes in a war club,<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> and Bourke observed at Taos pueblo a
similar weapon with iron teeth.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> But the number of specimens found
mounted indicates that most of them were used as knives or scrapers.</p>

inches long; convex base; edges
straight to the base, where they
expand somewhat, giving the implement
a bell shape. The largest
specimen in the lot (<a href="#FIG_180">figure 180</a>) has
both faces polished almost the entire
length, a feature absent from
all the others. This example is from
Caldwell county, North Carolina.
The form is found also in central
and western North Carolina, eastern
Tennessee, northeastern Kentucky;
Kanawha valley; and northeastern
Arkansas. Few of the flints
occur in the collection except from
the two localities first mentioned, where they are
moderately abundant.</p>

<p><i>E.</i> Elliptical outline; some very thin, others resembling celts. One
from Kanawha valley has the projecting facets and ridges on one face
very smooth from use, those on the other being still
sharp, as when first chipped. The one figured has the
edge worn smooth entirely around,
seemingly from use as a cutting tool,
the ends being most worn. Represented
by <a href="#FIG_181">figure 181</a> (from Dane county,
Wisconsin). Found also in southern
and southwestern Wisconsin; eastern
Tennessee; northeastern Arkansas;
central and western North Carolina;
Brown county, Illinois; Kanawha valley;
and South Carolina.</p>

the base being regularly rounded. This
is the model of the pointed oval or leaf-shape
flint. Sometimes one face is flatter than the other, being less
worked, or in a few cases the unaltered flat side of a flake. Usually
they are quite symmetrical, but occasionally one edge is more curved

wide and thin; the former
probably clubs or spearheads,
the latter knives. A

<h5 id="SMALLER_OBJECTS">SMALLER OBJECTS.</h5>

<p>Small triangular or oval arrowpoints, differing from those previously
described in being too small for any similar uses, few of them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
being so much as two inches in length, and varying from that size to
not more than half an inch. Nearly all
are very thin, though some of the narrower
ones may have a diamond or thick
lenticular section. Some are very slender,
so much so that they are usually classed
as perforators; others are equilateral.
Both the base and edges may be straight,
convex, or concave. A few have a shallow
notch in each edge just above the corner;
nearly all, however, have both base and

</div>
</div>

<p>The groups and subdivisions which have been recognized among the
smaller chipped flint objects in the Bureau collection may be enumerated
as follows:</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Concave base. The concavity may vary from almost a straight
line to one-third the length of the flint. Usually symmetric, as in
figures 190 and 191, though sometimes one tang or barb, if it may be
called such, is longer than the other, as in <a href="#FIG_192">figure 192</a>. A very few
have beveled or serrated edges.</p>

<p>1. Convex edges. The type, shown
in <a href="#FIG_190">figure 190</a>, is from Jefferson county,
Tennessee. Other specimens are
from eastern Tennessee; Union county,
Mississippi; northwestern Georgia,
and Bibb county and Savannah in the
same state; central and western North
Carolina; Miami and Scioto valleys
and central Ohio; Kanawha valley,
West Virginia; South Carolina; and
southwestern Arkansas.</p>

<p>2. Straight edges, as in the specimen illustrated in <a href="#FIG_191">figure 191</a>, from
Ouachita county, Arkansas. Similar specimens are found in northeastern
and southwestern Arkansas; western and central North Carolina;
Kanawha valley; eastern Wisconsin; northwestern Georgia, and
Savannah; eastern Tennessee; South Carolina; southwestern
Illinois; Union county, Mississippi; and northeastern
Kentucky.</p>

<p>3. Concave edges. This abundant form is illustrated
in figures 192 (Cherokee county, Georgia), 193 (Caldwell
county, North Carolina), and 194 (Washington county,
Virginia). Other specimens are from northwestern
Georgia and Savannah; central and western North
Carolina; Kanawha valley; eastern Tennessee; northeastern Kentucky;
southwestern Arkansas; South Carolina; Union county, Mississippi;
and Coosa valley, Alabama. This subdivision of group <i>A</i> is
abundant, as well as widely distributed.</p>

short and the long ones slender. Most of them are both short and
narrow.</p>

<p>1. Convex edges as in figures 195 (McMinn county, Tennessee) and 196
(Bradley county, Tennessee). The form is widely distributed, being
represented by specimens from eastern Tennessee;
northeastern, southwestern, and southeastern Arkansas;
Scioto valley, Ohio; northeastern Kentucky;
northwestern Georgia and Savannah;
Kanawha valley; Union county,
Mississippi; Holt county, Missouri;
northeastern Alabama, and Coosa valley
in the same state; southern and southwestern
Wisconsin; and western North

<p>2. Straight edges. Exemplified by the specimen
shown in <a href="#FIG_197">figure 197</a>, from McMinn county, Tennessee.
Found also in eastern Tennessee; northeastern Arkansas;
Coosa valley, Alabama; Union county, Mississippi;

<p>3. Concave edges, as in <a href="#FIG_198">figure 198</a> (from
Bledsoe county, Tennessee). Other examples
of this class are from eastern Tennessee;
Scioto valley, Ohio; northeastern and
southwestern Arkansas; Kanawha valley,
West Virginia; northeastern Kentucky; western and central North
Carolina; northeastern Alabama; southwestern Illinois; and Savannah,
Georgia.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> Convex bases. Less abundant than the preceding,
and the forms representing it are less variable. Its
sub-groups are as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="FIG_199" src="images/fig_199.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 199.</span>&mdash;Chipped
flint, convex base.</p>
</div>

<p>1. Convex edges. Some of these have a slight reverse
curve at the base, giving a slight barb or shoulder. A
few are widest at or near the middle, with bases somewhat
pointed, but most of them are widest at the junction
of the base and edges. They are mostly of the leaf-shaped
type, but quite small. <a href="#FIG_199">Figure 199</a> (Mississippi
county, Arkansas) is a good example. Others are from
northeastern and southwestern Arkansas; northeastern
Alabama and Coosa valley; Kanawha valley, West
Virginia; eastern Tennessee; western and central North
Carolina; northwestern Georgia; eastern Wisconsin; southwestern
Illinois, and Miami valley, Ohio.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span></p>

<p>2. Edges concave or nearly straight. There are very few of this
form, as nearly all with the base convex have the edges also convex.
The type (<a href="#FIG_200">figure 200</a>) is from Lawrence county, Ohio; others are from
Miami and Scioto valleys, Ohio; Kanawha valley; and
southeastern and southwestern Arkansas.</p>

<p>Two exceptional forms, which may be considered
modifications of the triangular, come from
eastern Tennessee and western North
Carolina. The first, which is pentagonal,
is shown in <a href="#FIG_201">figure 201</a>; the second, a medium
between a perforator and a deeply
serrated, triangular arrowpoint, is shown
in <a href="#FIG_202">figure 202</a>.</p>

<p>While it is likely that the smaller flints,
last described, were intended for arrows, it can not be
stated with confidence whether they were for use in war
or in hunting. It is said that some of the western
Indians used barbless arrows with, long, tapering blades, firmly attached
to the shaft, for hunting, while for war barbed arrows, only slightly
attached, were employed.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a></p>

<p>In many arrows with triangular points in the National
Museum the sinew with which the flint is fastened to the
shaft is brought over the corner or shoulder in such a way
as to bind the point as firmly as could be done if it were
barbed or stemmed, so that when the shaft is drawn from a
wound the point must come with it. If an arrowhead of
this form were inserted in a shaft, which was then wrapped
behind the flint, the latter would remain in the wound
when the shaft was withdrawn.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="FIG_202" src="images/fig_202.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 202.</span>&mdash;Chipped
flint,
narrow and
thick.</p>
</div>

<p>There is no reason for supposing that only the larger
points were used for war purposes; the greater penetrating
power of the thin, sharp ones would seem to fit them especially
for such work, and it is probable that the smaller
straight or tapering-stemmed flints (next to be described)
were also utilized for this purpose, as they could be easily detached.
Those with expanding stem may have been used for hunting, as they
could be permanently fastened to the shaft.</p>

<h4 id="STEMMED_FLINTS"><span class="smcap">Stemmed Flints.</span></h4>

<p>The abundant and variable material of this class may roughly be
grouped by form into two divisions, in the first of which the stem is
tapering or straight, while in the second the stem is generally expanding.</p>

<h5 id="STRAIGHT_OR_TAPER_STEMS">STRAIGHT OR TAPER STEMS.</h5>

<p><i>A.</i> Square or rounded shoulders; stem concave at base; edges usually
convex, rarely straight or concave. Nearly all are of quartzite or coarse
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
flint, roughly worked, the one illustrated (<a href="#FIG_203">figure 203</a>) being above the
average, and are mostly from western North Carolina and the adjacent
portions of South Carolina and Tennessee. All of them exceed three
inches in length. Those from Savannah, Georgia, are usually much
wider relative to the length than the specimens in the Bureau collection
from other localities.</p>

<p>The specimen figured is from Montgomery county, North Carolina;
others are from western and central North
Carolina; Kanawha valley; eastern Tennessee;
South Carolina; Coosa valley, Alabama; and
northwestern Georgia and Savannah.</p>

<p><i>B.</i> Similar to the last, except that the base
is straight or convex, instead of concave. Large
size, and nearly all of rough finish; mostly of
argillite or flint, a few of quartzite. Varying
considerably in width, as well as in thickness,
some having almost a diamond section, others
wide and thin, the latter generally having the
edges worked quite sharp. Some are made
from a large flake which has been dressed on
one side only. One from Montgomery
county, North Carolina,
has the end opposite the stem
worked round and sharp, similar
to the blunt arrowheads, but its
size excludes it from this class.
From Savannah there are several which are chipped
very thin, and smoothly finished, but they are exceptional;
some from this locality are very large, reaching
5 by 3 inches, while others are almost as wide as they are
long.</p>

<p>The specimens of this form are chiefly from western and
central North Carolina; eastern Tennessee; South Carolina;
southwestern Georgia, and Savannah; eastern Wisconsin;
southwestern Arkansas; southwestern Illinois; northwestern Alabama
and Coosa valley in the same state; Kanawha valley, West Virginia;
and central Ohio.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> Of the same general form as the last, but much smaller, and finely
worked. Most seem to be intended for arrowheads. The specimen
illustrated in <a href="#FIG_204">figure 204</a> is from Caldwell county, North Carolina;
others are from South Carolina; western and central North Carolina;
Union county, Mississippi; eastern Tennessee; Coosa valley and Tuscaloosa,

<p><i>D.</i> Convex edges; stem usually tapering with straight base, though
it is noticeable that some are straight with convex base. Resembling
the last in form, but slender; from 1&frac34; to 4&frac14; inches long. From western
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>

edges.</p></div>
</div>
</div>

<p><i>E.</i> Differing from specimen
shown in <a href="#FIG_203">figure 203</a>, in having
the edges expand at the shoulders
in a projection or point,
and varying more in size, some
being small enough for arrowheads.
All from Savannah
(including the example shown
in <a href="#FIG_205">figure 205</a>) are of smoother
finish than those from other
sections, and are usually
larger, ranging from 2&frac12; to 4&frac12;
inches long. There are some from this locality
with base straight or convex. Found also in western and central
North Carolina; Kanawha valley; South Carolina; eastern Tennessee;
Coosa valley and northeastern Alabama; Brown county, Illinois; northeastern,
southeastern, and southwestern Arkansas; and southwestern
Georgia.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Edge having a double curve, being convex toward the point, and
curving outward at the shoulders. Few of them are barbed, though
many have the shoulder much expanded. Base sometimes
convex or concave, but more often straight; in a
few it is somewhat pointed. In most of the smaller
specimens the base is notched, but of
these none are over 2&frac12; inches long. Stem
tapering or expanding, rarely straight.
A few have the base rubbed smooth and
dull, or even polished (this feature appears
in other forms, as noted); it seems
to result from use as a knife or scraper,
but the implement as a whole does not
appear to be adapted to such use. None
of them are over 3&frac12; inches long, except
a few from Savannah; all from there are
wide, but from other places the longer
ones are all narrow.</p>

about the medium.</p>

<p>The form, which resembles that
shown in <a href="#FIG_216">figure 216</a> in a general
way, is widely distributed, its
range including Keokuk, Iowa;
Miami and Scioto valleys, Ohio;

From Kanawha valley; northwestern Georgia; Miami and Scioto valleys,
Ohio; southwestern Arkansas; southern Wisconsin; and northeastern
Alabama.</p>

<p>Beginning with those of group <i>N</i> and ending with those last described,
all the best worked and most finely finished specimens are

base usually convex, sometimes
straight, rarely concave. A specimen
from Ross county, Ohio, has
the base deeply notched; it seems
to have been symmetrical originally,
and one barb or shoulder
being broken, to have had that
edge dressed down. Many were
thus reworked, but in most cases
it is evident that the form is
original. Some are slender, others
broad.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Short and broad; base usually
straight, sometimes convex, rarely concave;
notched in from edges to form the
stem; very seldom with well-defined
shoulders, and never barbed. The type,
illustrated in <a href="#FIG_219">figure 219</a>, is from Kanawha

northeastern Kentucky; western North
Carolina; northwestern Georgia and about Savannah; eastern Tennessee;
Coosa valley, Alabama; and Union county, Mississippi.</p>

<p><i>B.</i> Edges convex, seldom straight; base straight or rarely convex
or concave; notched in on edges close to base, so as to leave a slight

tang; thin and well worked; from an inch to 2&frac14; inches long. All from
Savannah have concave bases; a few are notched so as to have slight
shoulders, and they are somewhat larger than from other localities.
They fit better in this group, however, than in any other. A typical
example, shown in <a href="#FIG_220">figure 220</a>, is
from Montgomery county, North
Carolina. Others are from central
North Carolina; eastern Tennessee;
southwestern Illinois; various localities
in South Carolina; and about
Savannah, Georgia.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> Roughly made; unsymmetrical,
seemingly made hastily; of various
patterns, including all the common
shapes. Nearly all with convex
edges, few straight, none concave.
Base straight or concave, often the
natural surface or fracture of the stone. Sometimes made from the
tip of a broken larger specimen. From 1 to 5 inches long; slender or
wide; usually thick, except when made from a thin flake. Edges
notched just at the base in some, leaving a slight tang; others have
the corners chipped out. This group is quite variable in size and in
character of workmanship, as well as in form. The material also is
variable.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 237.</span>&mdash;Stemmed
chipped flint, oval
outline, notched.</p>
</div>

<p><i>P.</i> Convex edges and base; sometimes, though very
seldom, the edges are nearly straight; the typical,
leaf-shape implement, except for the notch, which is
always worked in from the widest part of the specimen
at right angles to the axis. The base is invariably
polished, even in the smallest specimens. From Licking
county (<a href="#FIG_237">figure 237</a>) as well as from Miami valley and
throughout central Ohio; Kanawha valley; eastern Tennessee;
southwestern Illinois; northeastern Alabama;
southern Wisconsin; and about Savannah, Georgia.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Edges less convex than the last, sometimes
straight; the notches are worked in nearer the base,
going in an angle of about 45 degrees, instead of perpendicular
to the middle line or axis. Sometimes the blade
is of uniform thickness until very close to the edges,
which are worked off in a double chisel-edge. Very
few of these, or of group <i>P</i>, are small enough for arrows.
Usually symmetrical and well finished; the base always
polished, but whether from use or to add to the utility of the specimen
can not be determined. From Miami valley, Ohio; Keokuk, Iowa;
southwestern Wisconsin; and eastern Tennessee.</p>

<p><i>R.</i> Differing from the two last described only in being
longer, and in having the stem always come to a point
by either convex or concave lines, instead of being regularly
convex; base never polished. From Kanawha
valley, West Virginia, and central Arkansas.</p>

<p><i>S.</i> Edges usually straight, sometimes concave, rarely
convex; notched in deeply from edges; seldom barbed;
stem nearly always wider than the blade, and large.
Base convex; occasionally somewhat concave with
rounded corners, and nearly always polished. Some
(including all from the Savannah collection) are beveled
and a few have blunt and rounded points, apparently
broken specimens reworked. From less than an inch
to nearly 3 inches long. Even among the very small
ones, some have the base polished.</p>

<p>An implement of this form, or of any form in which the stem is wide
or with very long tangs, and especially with concave base, would be
well adapted for hunting purposes. The wide stem would allow firm
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
attachment to a shaft, whether as an arrow or a spear, and at the same
time would be very difficult to withdraw from a wound. The shaft
would impede the flight of an animal pierced by the weapon, particularly
in weeds or bushes; though greater force
would be required with these than with the
more slender points to make them effective.</p>

straight, convex, or concave, in some specimens of each
being polished; notched in on the edges just above the
corners, notches usually slight; always widest at base.
A few, including all from Savannah, are serrated or
beveled. Very few are over an inch and a half long. They
are nearly always thick. One from Kanawha valley has
the point worn perfectly smooth and the edges polished
half way to the base, showing use as a drill. Points of

<p>This form is widely distributed. The type (<a href="#FIG_243">figure 243</a>) is from Lawrence
county, Ohio. Its range includes Miami and
Scioto valleys, Ohio; northwestern Georgia and Savannah;
eastern Tennessee; Kanawha valley; southwestern
Illinois, and Brown county in the same state;
western North Carolina; Coosa valley, Alabama; southwestern
Arkansas; South Carolina; northeastern Kentucky;
and eastern Wisconsin.</p>

<p><i>Z.</i> Very rough finish; blade more or less worked by
first chipping (there being usually no secondary chipping)
to convex edges; base generally the natural surface of the
nodule or pebble from which the implement was made; notches worked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
in roughly on the edges. They were probably knives or spears, or in
some cases celts or chisels, though none show polish. With these are
placed a few that seem to be the points of larger rough implements,
broken and having notches worked in the fragments. A typical form,
shown in <a href="#FIG_244">figure 244</a>, is from Mississippi county, Arkansas. It occurs
also in northeastern Arkansas; Scioto valley, Ohio; western Tennessee;
southwestern Illinois; and Kanawha valley, West Virginia.</p>

<h4 id="PERFORATORS"><span class="smcap">Perforators.</span></h4>

<h5 id="CHARACTER_AND_USES">CHARACTER AND USES.</h5>

<p>The implements variously classed by different writers as awls, drills,
needles, rimmers or reamers, and the like, seem to represent a graded
series, and as no distinction can be made in the different kinds, if,
indeed, there is any room for distinction, they are grouped under one
term, ‚Äúperforators.‚Äù</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="FIG_244" src="images/fig_244.jpg"  alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 244.</span>&mdash;Stemmed
chipped flint, very
rough.</p>
</div>

<p>Very few of the specimens could be used as drills, as most of them
are too thin; only those with a rhomboidal or triangular
section would seem adapted to this purpose, and the
majority even of these seem too fragile. It is more
probable that drilling was done with a stick or horn,
with sand as a cutting medium, except in the thin tablets
of slate or similar stone and in shells. The thicker
flints would answer very well for this purpose, and the
countersunk holes appear to indicate such an instrument.
For sewing, bone would be more easily worked,
and better suited than flint. The double-pointed
slender specimens may have been used for bait-holders
in fishing; bone implements of a similar shape, with a
hole drilled at the middle for attaching a line, have
been seen in use among the Indians of Florida.</p>

<p>Some such implement was no doubt used in the manner
of a burin, especially in making the fine lines on
the ornamented shells or stones; certain flints in the
collection may have served such a purpose.</p>

<p>Lubbock considers it proved that the stone of which
ornaments, carved axes, etc., are made could be worked
with flint, and that the engraving on the Scotch rocks,
even on granite, was executed with this material;<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> and Bushmen are
known to use triangular pieces of flint for cutting figures in rocks.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a>
Evans<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> observes that there are five ways of making holes in stone, viz.:
(1) Chiseling or picking, with ‚Äúpicks,‚Äù ‚Äúcelts,‚Äù or ‚Äúdrills‚Äù of flint or
other stone; (2) boring with a solid borer, as wood, hard or soft, or
horn with sand and water; (3) grinding with a tubular grinder, as
horn, cane, elder, etc., with sand and water; (4) drilling with a stone
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
drill, e.g., of flint or sandstone; (5) drilling or punching with metal.
It should be remembered that there are no evidences of the use of any
metal except copper for economic purposes by the
aborigines of the United States; and nearly everything
of this material seems to have been ornamental
in character. Bancroft says that the Nootka, in boring
in wood, use a bird-bone drill worked between
the hands,<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> while according to Schumacher, the
Santa Barbara Indians chip out rough disks of shell,
pierce them with a flint drill, and enlarge the hole
with a slender, round piece of sandstone.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a> The
Atlantic coast Indians drilled shell beads with a nail
stuck in a cane or stick, rolling the drill on their
thighs with the right hand, and holding the shell in
the left;<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> and the southern Indians, according to
C. C. Jones, pierced shell beads with heated copper
drills.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> Evans has found that ox-horn and sand
make good borers,<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> while low tribes on the Amazon
make crystal tubes an inch in diameter and up to 8
inches long by rubbing and drilling with a flexible
shoot of wild plantain, twilled between the hands,
with sand and water;<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> and Tylor expresses the opinion
that such operations are not the result of high
mechanical skill, but merely of the most simple and savage processes.<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a></p>

<h5 id="STEMLESS_FORMS">STEMLESS FORMS.</h5>

<p><i>A.</i> Base straight or nearly so; edges straight and parallel, sometimes
half the length from the base, thence with concave curve which is
reversed near the end to give a blunt point; these, usually
the wider ones, are always thin, and were probably
knives. The smaller ones, resembling the small triangular
arrows except for the sharpened upper end, may have
been for arrowheads, though the sharp points would have
served well as awls or needles. Many of the smaller ones
seem to be made from small broken arrowheads; exemplified
by the specimen from Montgomery county, North
Carolina, shown in <a href="#FIG_245">figure 245</a>. The collection includes material
from western and central North Carolina; eastern
Tennessee; Kanawha valley; northeastern Alabama;

<p><i>B.</i> Slender, somewhat larger about the middle and
tapering to a point at each end, or regularly and gradually decreasing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
from base to point. Some are undoubtedly arrowheads, as they are too
blunt or too thin to have been used for piercing. Others show marks
of use which could have been produced in no way except by drilling
in stone. The specimen illustrated in <a href="#FIG_246">figure 246</a> (from
Kanawha valley) shows this to a marked degree, while
that shown in <a href="#FIG_247">figure 247</a> (from Nicholas
county, Kentucky) is without such indications.

northeastern Kentucky; southwestern

<p><i>C.</i> With the base very large in ratio
to the point or piercer; sometimes the
entire implement is worked smooth or
thin, again it is the natural fragment or
chip of stone entirely unworked except a point flaked on one part or
edge. The piercer varies from one-fourth of an inch to two inches in
length. It could have been utilized only as an ‚Äúawl‚Äù or ‚Äúneedle,‚Äù
the base being held by the thumb and finger. This variable form is
represented in <a href="#FIG_248">figure 248</a> (from Lawrence county, Ohio). It comes from

<p><i>D.</i> Piercer thin and slender; base thin, expanding
to a wing-like projection on each side. Very few are
strong enough to have been used for drilling even in
soft material, but they are excellent for piercing
leather or similar substances. The expanding wings
would make them good points for
hunting and fishing arrows, as they
would have great penetrating power
and be very difficult to extract from a
wound, while allowing very firm attachment
to a shaft. The type, shown in
<a href="#FIG_249">figure 249</a>, is from Kanawha valley.
Other specimens come from the same
locality, and also from southwestern
Illinois, and Brown county in the same
state; eastern Tennessee; Keokuk,

Kentucky; southern Wisconsin; and Savannah, Georgia.</p>

<p><i>E.</i> With slight expansion at the base. These may be thick or thin,
wide or narrow, and, according to their different forms, might be used
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
as drills, piercers, or arrowheads. A good example (presented in <a href="#FIG_250">figure

<p><i>C.</i> Narrow and thick
almost of a diamond or
round section; stem expanding
or straight; with
slight shoulders, sometimes
slightly barbed.
Some of the thinner ones,
probably arrows, have a
lenticular section; a few
are triangular in section.
This form is well suited for drilling, and many of the specimens show
marks of such use, especially the one illustrated (<a href="#FIG_253">figure 253</a>), the edges
of which are striated almost the entire length. This is from Mason
county, Kentucky; and the distribution of the type includes Kanawha

western and central North Carolina; southeastern and northeastern
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
Arkansas; Brown county, Illinois; South Carolina; and northeastern
Kentucky. Thus the type is common and its geographic range broad.</p>

<p><i>D.</i> Long, slender point; shoulders wide or slightly barbed; stem
straight, tapering, or expanding; edges straight or concave. Some
would make good piercers for soft material, but very few could be used
as drills. A majority would be good arrowheads. Some have the edges
smooth, but if this was caused by drilling it
must have been done in enlarging holes already
made, since the implements so marked are very
thin. The faces of the blades show no polish or
smoothness, such as might result from use as
knives. The specimen illustrated (<a href="#FIG_254">figure 254</a>) is
from Madison county, Alabama; others from
northeastern Alabama and Coosa valley; Scioto
valley, Ohio; eastern Tennessee; western and

worked, with edges parallel its entire length, and terminating in a cutting
edge instead of a point. This form (shown in <a href="#FIG_255">figure 255</a>) is found
only in the collection from Savannah, Georgia.</p>

<h4 id="BLUNT_ARROWHEADS_OR_BUNTS"><span class="smcap">Blunt Arrowheads, or ‚ÄúBunts.‚Äù</span></h4>

<p>Certain arrowheads have the end opposite the base rounded or flattened
instead of pointed. Commonly, both faces are worked off equally,
to bring the edge opposite the middle line of the blade, though sometimes
it may be a little to one side. The stem
and base are of any form found in the common
patterns of arrowheads. Few are barbed,
though many have shoulders. For the most
part, they are probably made from the ordinary
spearpoints or arrowheads and knives
that have had the points broken off, though
some seem to have been intentionally made
this way originally. A few are smooth or
polished at the ends, as though used as
knives or scrapers; but most of them have no marks except such as
would result from being struck or shot against some hard substance;
even this being absent in many of them, as in the specimen represented
in the accompanying figure.</p>

<p>Jones says that crescent-shaped arrows were used by southern Indians
for shooting off birds‚Äô heads,<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> and it is known that chisel-shape arrows
were much used during the Middle Ages.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a></p>

<p>The same remarks as to form and method of making apply to
stemmed scrapers as to blunt arrows, except that the chipping of the
end is always from one face so as to produce a chisel edge. This edge
is frequently smooth or polished from use. They would answer very well
for smoothing down articles
made of wood, or
for cleaning hides in tanning;
they would also
serve excellently for removing
scales from fish,
and as they are usually
abundant in the vicinity
of good fishing places,
they were no doubt employed for this purpose.</p>

<h5 id="STEMLESS">STEMLESS.</h5>

<p>A few quotations regarding the use
and mode of manufacture of stemless scrapers may be given:</p>

<p>According to Evans, they are made by laying a flake flat side up on
a stone, and chipping off around the edge with a hammer. The point
struck must rest directly on the under stone, and but a thin spall is
struck off at each blow.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> Leidy observed that the Shoshoni by a quick
blow strike off a segment of a quartz bowlder in such a way as to form
a circular or oval implement flat on one side, convex on the other, which
is used as a scraper in dressing buffalo hides;<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> and according to Knight
the Australians obtain, in exactly the same way, specimens which they
use as axes.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> Peale remarks that while hides are green they are
stretched on the ground and scraped with an instrument resembling an
adze;<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> and Dodge says more explicitly that when the stretched skin has
become hard and dry, the woman goes to work on it with an adze-like
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
instrument, with a short handle of wood or elkhorn tied on with rawhide;
holding this in one hand, she chips at the hardened skin, cutting
off a thin shaving at every blow.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a></p>

<p>The scrapers of this class in the Bureau collection are as follows:</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Chipped over the entire surface to the form of the ordinary celt,
except that the scraping edge is in the same plane with one face. Some
have a scraping edge at each end. In a few the flat or straight face
is chipped off slightly, bringing
the edge toward the middleline;
but this was probably
done after the implement had
become broken or blunted
from use. When there is any
polish, it is always on the flat
face, showing use as an adze,
or, possibly, as a plane. Varying
much in width, some measuring
almost the same in either
direction, while others are
more like the ‚Äúchisel‚Äù celts,
though the position of the
cutting edge shows their use.</p>

<p>A typical specimen (<a href="#FIG_259">figure

Jackson county, Illinois;
others come from Brown county and the southwestern
part of the state generally; from northeastern Kentucky;
Keokuk, Iowa; southwestern Wisconsin; eastern Tennessee;
and central Ohio.</p>

<p><i>B.</i> Flakes or spalls, chipped always from the concave
side of the fragment. Some of the smaller specimens,
usually those of somewhat circular outline, are chipped
nearly, or in some cases entirely, around the edge. Figure
260 represents a specimen from Mason county, Kentucky.
Others come from northeastern Kentucky; eastern
Tennessee; Holt county, Missouri; Kanawha valley;

<h4 id="CORES"><span class="smcap">Cores.</span></h4>

<p>The generally accepted name ‚Äúcores‚Äù is applied to the blocks from
which are struck off the flakes to be next described.</p>

<p>Dr. Gillespie<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> claimed that objects of this kind were made so intentionally,
and that the flakes are simply the refuse or waste material.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
He gives six reasons for this belief, but an examination of the objects
themselves would show that he is in error. That some might have
been used as scrapers may be true, but very few are suited for such
work, and not one shows the least mark of wear that could result from
this use.</p>

<p>The specimens in the Bureau collection, with perhaps half a dozen
exceptions, are from the aboriginal quarries at Flint ridge, in Licking
county, Ohio, or of the material so abundant at that place.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="FIG_261" src="images/fig_261.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 261.</span>&mdash;Cores.</p>
</div>

<p>All are small, few being of a size to furnish flakes over three inches
long. The flakes were undoubtedly
struck off by means
of stone hammers, hundreds of
which are to be found about the
quarries, or removed by pressure,
many showing the bulb of
percussion, others being perfectly
smooth on the flat face.
Usually all the flakes were obtained
from only one side of the
core until it became too small
to work (<a href="#FIG_261">figure 261</a>). Occasionally they were chipped
from opposite sides, leaving the core of a conical or
cylindrical shape (as represented in <a href="#FIG_262">figure 262</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="FIG_262" src="images/fig_262.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 262.</span>&mdash;Core.</p>
</div>

<p>Cores and finely chipped implements of the Flint
ridge stone have been taken from the mounds in
Kanawha valley, West Virginia, and Scioto valley,
Ohio, showing that the mound-builders are to be
credited with at least a part of the great amount of
work done in those localities; but it seems a mistake
to say, as some authors have done, that the
‚Äúturtlebacks‚Äù found in caches in southern Illinois
are from the same source, as the stone is entirely
different, and occurs abundantly in the vicinity in which the specimens
are found.</p>

<h4 id="FLAKES"><span class="smcap">Flakes.</span></h4>

<p>The use to which were put the narrow, thin flakes so abundantly found
in many parts of the world has caused some discussion. Schoolcraft
says that the Dakota bleed patients by scarifying with these flakes; or
sometimes one is fixed into the end of a piece of wood, held over a vein,
and driven in as far as the wood will let it go,<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> the use being similar to
that of the modern fleam. Harpoons in the Kurile islands are made of
bone, with a deep groove along each side; in these grooves thin and
sharp flat flakes are fastened with gum.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> According to Evans, similar
flakes were used for scraping,<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a> just as broken glass is used among modern
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
woodworkers. Flakes have been found in the Swiss lakes in wooden
handles in the fashion of Eskimo knives; also in Australia with skin
wrapped around one end to protect the hand.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a></p>

<p>All the flakes in the Bureau collection are small, few of them being
over three inches long. They are found elsewhere with a length of over
a foot; but the nature of the flint occurring in the United States is
seldom such as to allow flakes to be struck off equaling in size those
found in Europe.</p>

<p>Evans says that blows with a pebble will form just such flakes as
those produced by an iron hammer; the blows must, however, be delivered
in exactly the right spot and with the proper force. Cores sometimes
show markings of hammers when struck too near the edge.
Flakes can be produced by using a pebble as a set or punch and striking
it with a stone. The use of a set was probably the exception
rather than the rule, for great precision may be obtained simply with
a hammer held in the hand. The Eskimo use a hammer set in a handle
to strike off flakes, or strike them off by slight taps with a hammer
of jade, oval in shape, about 2 by 3 inches, and secured to a bone handle
with sinew.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a></p>

<p>According to Tylor, the Peruvian Indians work obsidian by laying a
bone wedge on the surface of a piece and tapping it until the stone
cracks;<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> while the Indians of Mexico hold a piece of obsidian 6 or 8
inches long between their feet, then holding the crosspiece of a T-shape
stick against the breast they place the other end against the
stone and force off a piece by pressure.<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a></p>

<p>Nilsson says that the Eskimo set a point of deer horn into a handle
of ivory and drive off splinters from the chert,<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> and Redding saw a
Cloud river Indian make flakes thus: Holding a piece of obsidian in
his hand, he placed the straight edge of a piece of split deer horn, four
inches long and half an inch in diameter, at a distance from the edge
of the stone equal to the thickness of the arrow he wished to make;
then striking the other end with a stone he drove off a flake.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> Schumacher
observed that the Klamath Indians heat a stone and break it
into fragments at a single blow.<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a></p>

<p>According to Stevens the Shasta Indian lays a stone anvil on his knee,
and holding on the anvil the stone which he is working,<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> strikes off a
flake one-fourth of an inch thick with a stone hammer; but Powers
says the Shasta Indians heat a stone and allow it to cool slowly, which
splits it into flakes,<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> and Bancroft that they place an obsidian pebble
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
on an anvil of stone and split it with an agate chisel to the required
size.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> The Shoshoni or Snake Indians of the northwest work in the
same way,<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> and certain California Indians strike off flakes from a mass
of agate, jasper, or chalcedony with a stone hammer,<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a> while the Apache
break a bowlder of hornstone with a heavy stone hammer having a
twisted withe for a handle.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a></p>

<p>Schoolcraft says experience has taught the Indians that some varieties
of hornstone (flint) are less easily fractured than others, and that
the conchoidal form is found best in softer varieties; also that weathered
fragments are managed with greater difficulty than are those
freshly quarried.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a></p>

<p>Evans points out that in making gunflints much depends upon the
condition of the stone as regards the moisture it contains, those that
have been too long exposed on the surface becoming intractable, and
there is also a difficulty in working those that are too moist. Some of
the workers, however, say that a flint which has been some time
exposed to the air is harder than one recently dug, yet it works equally
well.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a></p>

<p>It is related that in former times white hunters
in Ohio and Kentucky, when they needed
a gunflint, would select a fragment from the
surface, where practicable, and soak it in oil
for several weeks ‚Äúto make it tough;‚Äù otherwise
it would shatter to fragments when
struck.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 263.</span>&mdash;Flake, chipped for

</div>

<p>Frequently the large flat spalls knocked
from blocks or chunks of flint in shaping
them, or in obtaining pieces to work, are of
such form that very little additional labor
converts them into serviceable scrapers,
knives, spears, or arrows. A number of such
pieces are found in the collection. These,
however, are not considered in the flakes now to be described:</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Edges bluntly chipped (from the concave side) for use as scrapers.
They may or may not have notches for attachment to a handle. An
example from Kanawha valley, West Virginia, is shown in <a href="#FIG_263">figure 263</a>.
Others come from southwestern Arkansas; Kanawha valley; Miami
and Scioto valleys, and central Ohio.</p>

<p><i>B.</i> Trimmed only enough to give a general leaf shape, the faces being
left unchanged; for use as knives or arrowheads, most of them being
exceedingly small; notched, or with continuous edges. This form is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
represented by the specimen from Licking county, Ohio, illustrated
in <a href="#FIG_264">figure 264</a>. It is found in central Ohio; northeastern
Arkansas; Coosa valley, Alabama;
eastern Tennessee; and western
North Carolina.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> Long, slender, with three or
four facets on one face, caused by
others having been struck off above.
The edges are as keen as broken
glass, and the points are usually
quite sharp. In a great many the
points have been worked off by fine,
secondary chipping. When this is
done, it is always at the end which
was struck in knocking off the flake.
In some cases it may be due to the
shattering effects of the blow; but
in many specimens the evidence is
plain that it was done afterward for
the purpose of making a sharper point. Some flakes of this kind
have notches for attachment to a shaft, probably
for arrows; such specimens, however,
are without the secondary chipping, and the
notches are at the end opposite the one struck.</p>

<p>A good example, shown in <a href="#FIG_265">figure 265</a>, is

<h4 id="MISCELLANEOUS_FORMS"><span class="smcap">Miscellaneous Forms.</span></h4>

<p>From the Savannah collection there are
several forms of chipped flints which, while
resembling the foregoing in various ways,
present characters which make it necessary
to place them by themselves; and while containing
a majority of the types described
above, this collection has many that have
no counterpart from any other section visited
by the Bureau collectors. Some of these
unique specimens of aboriginal art are
among the following:</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Edges double curved, expanding to a wide point at the shoulder;
stem straight or tapering; base either straight or slightly convex.
The type of the group is quite well represented in <a href="#FIG_266">figure 266</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span></p>

<p><i>B.</i> Edges concave; base and stem straight; very wide projections or
wings at the shoulders, going in by straight or curved lines to the stem
(illustrated in <a href="#FIG_267">figure 267</a>).</p>

<p><i>C.</i> Edges concave, changing to convex at the shoulders, and curving
around to the stem, which is straight or slightly expanding; base
straight or very slightly convex (<a href="#FIG_268">figure 268</a>).</p>

<p><i>D.</i> Convex edges, widening into greatly expanding barbs; base

worked so as to be narrowest near the blade, with the ends straight or
round; stem expanding by straight lines; base straight (<a href="#FIG_270">figure 270</a>).</p>

<p><i>G.</i> Rather slender; base nearly straight, either convex or concave;
stem rapidly expanding; notched in from the corners, making long
slender barbs which project beyond the line of the edges (as illustrated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
in <a href="#FIG_272">figure 272</a>). The same form comes from Dougherty county, southwestern
Georgia, as well as from Savannah.</p>

<p><i>H.</i>  Straight or convex edges; base straight or slightly convex; stem
to one side of the center, leaving one barb longer and larger than the
other (<a href="#FIG_273">figure 273</a>).</p>

<p><i>I.</i> Triangular, notched in from the bottom;
barbs extend down even with the base, or the
base is sometimes worked back, leaving it shorter
than the barbs; some are beveled (<a href="#FIG_274">figure 274</a>). The
same form is found in southwestern Georgia.</p>

<p><i>K.</i> From Arkansas county,
Arkansas, there is an implement
of basanite or black
jasper, of the general type of
<a href="#FIG_180">figure 180</a> or 182, the point
being broken off. The base
has been worked down to a
sharp edge, the stem highly
polished on both faces. This
polish does not extend to the faces of the blade, but both edges are
rubbed smooth so far as they now extend. Whether the implement was
originally pointed and used as a knife or spear, this sharp edge being
given the stem after it was broken, or whether it was so made in the first
place, can not be determined. Like the various forms with polished
base, the specimen seems to indicate a manner of mounting or of use
the reverse of what would be expected. It is shown in <a href="#FIG_276">figure 276</a>.</p>

of the form of <a href="#FIG_205">figure 205</a>, except that it is wider and much
thinner. It is worn smooth on each edge for &frac34; inch from the point, the
point itself being quite blunt. This probably results from use as a
knife or drill; though, if due to the latter cause, the material on which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>

<p>In <a href="#FIG_278">figure 278</a> is shown a small knife of the pattern so common in
specimens mounted in antlers, from the Swiss lake dwellings. In outline
it resembles the arrowheads having straight edges and a convex
base; but the side view shows the purpose for which it was made. Similar
pieces are found throughout central Ohio, and along Ohio river
from the Kanawha to the Miami.</p>

<h3 id="NOTES_ON_BEVELED_FLINTS"><span class="smcap">Notes on beveled Flints.</span></h3>

<p>In the beveled flints the side-chipping producing the bevel is always
to the left, as may be seen in <a href="#FIG_235">figure 235</a>; only one exception to this has
been found. It has been supposed that this is done to give a rotary
motion to an arrow. Morgan<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a> says that ‚Äúarrowheads are occasionally
found with a twist to make the arrow revolve in its flight;‚Äù and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
the same statement has often been made by others. It may be objected,
however, that very few of these beveled specimens are small enough for
arrowheads; and modern archers have shown that the shape does not
affect the flight of the arrow.</p>

<p>Schoolcraft,<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a> Powers,<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a> Morgan,<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a> and Cheever<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a> say that the modern
Indians sometimes have a spiral arrangement of the feathers
on their arrow to produce a rotary motion or ‚Äúrifling.‚Äù This rotary
motion is supposed to keep the arrow in a straight course, as without
it a deviation from the direct line would tend constantly to increase.
But as showing that the rotary motion is not always desired, Dodge
says that sometimes the blade, in regard to the string notch, is set so
as to be perpendicular, to go in between the ribs of game; again, so as
to be horizontal, to go in between the ribs of an enemy.<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a></p>

<p>The beveled flints were probably used for skinning game, as they are
better fitted for this than for anything else, and would serve such purpose
better than almost any other form of the smaller chipped flints.
The bevel is such as would be necessary if the implement were held in
the right hand and pulled toward the user.</p>

<p>There are a great many specimens in the collection, both in the

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
